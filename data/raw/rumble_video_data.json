    "transcript": "So you've been lighting them up on X saying that Kamala Harris is a phony, that she effectively is delivering word salads that would make a sweet green barista blush. What's going on with this interview? You've seen some of the clips. Apparently, they're not going to release the whole thing. Maybe that's fake news, is it? Well, I don't know. We'll have to see when CNN actually airs it at nine o'clock coming up. I think you'd be able to tell if there were some edits there. And I think you're dead on about the set that they're using there. I mean, it looks like they went into some kind of WeWork space or something like that. I mean, what a nondescript... You would think for such an anticipated thing that they have so controlled every aspect of her post ever since she became the presumed nominee, they've controlled every minutiae, all the minutiae of it. Why would they pick that spot and that setting? It looks horrible on TV. It just looks terrible. Yes. She looks like she's sitting there with her lawyer in traffic court, and that's like a pre-trial thing, and they're hoping to get the speeding ticket dismissed. That's what it looks like right there. But her thing, the one clip that they released, \"My values haven't changed,\" it's pretty obvious that that's an answer that they workshopped quite a bit to land on that. Because obviously, she has never held the positions that her campaign is now claiming that she holds. She supports fracking now, give me a break. She does not support fracking, and Fox is running around calling it a flip-flop. She doesn't believe these things. If you say it's a flip-flop, it gives her credit for having these positions. We don't believe that these are her positions. It's the ones that she's had for decades. So when she says, \"My values haven't changed,\" well, then how on earth do you explain these 180-degree turns from what her old position used to be to what it supposedly is now? That means that she's even worse. That makes her more untrustworthy. If her values haven't changed, but she's still wildly changing her positions on certain very important policies, then you super-duper can't trust her. We knew that you couldn't trust her before, but now she's actually telling us, \"I don't believe these things that I'm saying.\" Because if she says her values haven't changed, then what she says today cannot possibly be true. You can't trust her. So that's the point. The thing I can't get over, Tim, and perhaps you could elucidate for me, how we are supposed to trust somebody whose party has been in power for 12 of the last 16 years, who says they're going to fix an America in shambles, and expresses that they are the ones, certainly not them, are the ones who are to blame for all of this. I can't justify it. Maybe it's working with some people. Maybe it is clicking with some people, that they don't blame Kamala Harris for the last 16 years of unified party Democrat control of the country. I mean, is this going to fly? And by the way, she's for a border wall now, which is crazy. Wow. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. When she says my values haven't changed, well, her old value, or at least the one we know about, was that the border wall is un-American. That's what she said. It's un-American. So if her values haven't changed, yet she claims to support the border wall now, how do you square those two things? It means she's a complete and utter phony, and she's actually admitting it. So I don't know how they think that these things are going to land. I'm not sure that this is a really high-quality strategy they've got here, but I'm afraid that they're saddled with the candidate who is, in fact, god-awful. There is a reason, Benny, why she withdrew from the presidential primaries in the 2020 Democratic primaries before it was even 2020. She quit in December of 2019, and there's a reason why she left the race with basically zero percent. It's because she's a bad candidate. She couldn't even survive in the field of Democratic candidates when she was pushing everything to the left. She's a California Democrat. She has never before ever carried an election on her own. When she ran nationally with Joe Biden, of course, she was running for vice president. She has never been the principal candidate on the ballot outside of California. And she's about to find out just how out of step her crazy leftist California view is. She's a San Francisco liberal, and she's pretending not to be one. That's her biggest problem. So let's talk through some of the polls today. Al, I know that you've been posting quite a few of them. Nate Silver has now Donald Trump back on top. It seems like there was no bump from the DMC convention. That's got to be very alarming for Kamala Harris and her team, along with the RFK endorsement of Donald Trump. Yeah, I would think that they are sort of in a panic mode over there, because Nate Silver's thing today, he had an extensive analysis of Pennsylvania. And Pennsylvania for Kamala Harris may be the whole ballgame. I think it's pretty clear, it's conventional wisdom, that everyone believes that the Democrats cannot win if they do not win Pennsylvania. They must win Pennsylvania. Now winning Pennsylvania does not guarantee victory for them, but they can't win without it. And Nate Silver at FiveThirtyEight had an extensive analysis today, and he's got Pennsylvania firmly in Donald Trump's camp. And if that holds, and I don't see any reason why it wouldn't, then Kamala Harris is really up against it. Because in Pennsylvania, she's going to do one of these things where she's going to have to go out there and try to get people to believe that she thinks certain things that everyone knows that she does not think. Like she's got to go to Pennsylvania and say, \"I support fracking,\" when she doesn't. She has to tell those workers in Western Pennsylvania, \"Hey, I'm looking out for your job in the natural gas industry,\" when she is not looking out for them, has not looked out for them, and will not look out for them. She's not good. You can tell. Every time she gets caught in these catchphrase loops, it's because she's talking about subject matter with which she's not very comfortable or familiar. And if she has to go to Western PA and look these natural gas workers in the face and say, \"I support your industry. I love fracking,\" no one's going to buy it because it's not true. It simply is not true. So Pennsylvania is a real big problem for her. And unfortunately for her, it means everything. It is 100% of the race. She might as well be running for the president of Pennsylvania, and she's not going to do it. There's no way she can get across the finish line because of the positions that she has always had. And it's not fooling anybody to say, \"Oh, you know what? 39 days ago, I woke up and I thought, 'Oh my gosh, I love fracking now. Who's going to buy that?'\" No one. You can see here, I mean, this is relatively disastrous. After the DNC convention, Joe Biden was up by 10 points on President Trump. Hillary Clinton was up by over 10 points on President Trump. Donald Trump would go on to win that race and would go on to win Pennsylvania, as you're talking about. And now you can see that Harris got no, Harris actually went down during the DNC convention, which lends to an interesting paradox here for Democrats, which is that the more people see of her, the more they dislike her. Right. Now, remember, this is exactly what happened in 2019. She started off, when she entered the race back then, she started off as kind of a buzzy candidate. There was a lot of buzz around Kamala Harris. The media was really focused on her as somebody who might be a real comer in the party, and they thought that maybe this is one of the ones who might be able to go to the distance and be one of the last few standing when they're trying to figure out exactly who was going to be the nominee back then. But she had that initial buzz. And then as soon as people started to get a look at her and watch her act, it began to quickly fall down and fall down and fall down. And next thing you know, she's at 0.5 percent before Iowa. And see you later. She's out of there. The same thing is happening now. The whole thing, her whole rise has been media fueled. It's a total sugar high. There's nothing inside this package that she and the media have carefully concocted. And we're going to see later tonight. It's not a performance problem. It's not like Joe Biden when he was in the debate where he could at any moment perform an actual face plant, right? Like a literal falling over and whacking his face on the floor. That could have happened. Right. We watched it happen. Actually. Yeah. It practically did. Yeah. But that's not Kamala Harris's problem. Her problem is not going out there and falling down or looking bewildered or any of those things. It's the content of what she says and the way that she says it and how you can tell that she's just absolutely full of it. Or you can also tell when she has no earthly idea what she's talking about. That's her problem. And now she's got to convince people that she believes something that she has never believed on like 20 different topics. It's a tall order for somebody who's good at politics. She's not good at politics. No way she's able to pull this off. Tim, since you just brought that up, I have to play you this very short 15 second clip from Kamala Harris. Just moments ago. We were at a rally where a lot of people were bussed in. We know that we have the local news cameras, like big buses taking people and maybe get your comment on that. But more importantly, you're a communications expert. This is your trade, your profession, the words that are coming out of a politician's mouth. Can you please make any sense of this? He even called for termination of the United States Supreme, the supreme land of our nation, the United States Constitution. What, what, what, what just happened? I got nothing. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know what she's talking about. She I mean, is she trying to he's going to what terminate the land of the United States or the supreme what? I don't know. I don't know what she's trying to talk about. Is she she alleging that somehow Donald Trump is going to what outlaw the Constitution? I don't know. I'm not sure exactly what she's going for there. You see, when she gets off teleprompter, she had a thread of a thought and then it was gone. And now she's out of her depth and she can't recover, you know. So that's the thing when she when she's talking about these issues, for example, on the border, I would love to hear her give an off script off teleprompter recitation of exactly why she supports Donald Trump's border wall after she called it un-American. There is no way she can give a credible defense of why it's important to build the border wall after spending years, years denigrating it as a waste of money, un-American. It's racist and blah, blah, so on and so forth. All the terrible things she said about it. Now she wants people to believe that she supports it. She uses images of it in her television ads. I mean, the whole thing is a farce. It's like a Saturday Night Live sketch. Honestly, God, you would be making up a candidate. This is a candidate who is now that she has become the nominee. Now they've set out to design a candidate, one who can get elected because the California Democrat cannot get elected, a lefty from California cannot get elected. But she's their candidate, so they have to un-California-ize her, I guess, if that's such a thing. But that's what they're trying to do. They're trying to get rid of all the crazy positions that she had. And that's why they've spent the last 39 days trying to lay the groundwork to make sure that the staff, not her, but that the staff tells the media, oh, yeah, she's changed her mind and all those things, because they knew she couldn't handle it. And they wanted the groundwork to be laid before she finally emerged. Now she's doing this interview with Tim Walz, who is basically a stand-in for her. He's like a human body pillow for her, so she can hug it if she gets nervous, right? That's his role there. And his thing, the unpaid volunteer assistant football coach running around like he's Andy freaking Reed. Who's buying that? What a phony that guy is, too. The two of them together are the phoniest, most deceitful presidential ticket in modern American history. It's really disgraceful, and it's actually frightening, the deception that they're attempting to pull off. It really is frightening. Think about it. She's running as something 100% phony candidate. All of her positions are phony, her act is phony, her running mate is phony, the way she became the nominee is phony, all of it, every bit of it. She helped lie to the country to cover up Joe Biden's decrepitude. That's phony. I've never seen anything so dishonest from beginning to end as this. [BLANK_AUDIO]"

    "transcript": "Kamala Harris's first interview is set. It is officially happening this coming more than a month after becoming the de facto and then of course now the official nominee for the Democratic Party for president. Kamala Harris has scheduled her first interview as I mentioned it won't be by herself, it won't be live, and it definitely won't be adversarial. It will be pre-recorded tomorrow with CNN's Dana Bash and it will air for everyone to view tomorrow night at 9 Eastern. Unclear how long the interview is going to be, unclear how edited it will be, but you can bet there will be cuts. That is the point of not doing it live. And of course it's it's not just Kamala Harris who has been avoiding the press, avoiding the interviews. Tim Walz, the vice presidential nominee, has not done interviews either. That is clearly a deliberate choice of the campaign as well. And the reason they're going to get into this interview together or do this together is the same reason you separate witnesses when you're investigating a crime or you're really investigating anything. You can't lie together when you're separated and contradictions matter. So that's why they're gonna have Walz and Kamala in there together is so they can get their story straight. If you talk to them separately one might say A and the other says B and you have a contradiction to resolve. And to that point it's not just the entire country that doesn't know what Kamala's policy positions actually are because she doesn't explain them. Maybe she will tomorrow. It is also Tim Walz. Politico Playbook reads this week quote, \"What about Tim?\" As in why won't Tim Walz do an interview either? One of the issues that Tim or that Harris world is currently working to address is how to deploy running mate Tim Walz to the media. The danger with sending him out to do big solo interviews is that he might not have a full command of where Harris is on every issue. As someone pointed out last night, Harris talks about it an opportunity economy. But what if Walz were asked to define it? Would he know? As though Kamala Harris knows what an opportunity economy is. There is no definition. That's the point. It is a, it just sounds good. It feels good. Ooh an opportunity economy. As opposed to what? A suffering economy? The problem is she and Joe Biden have created a suffering economy over the last four years. So and and and she's been personally a part of that too by ramming through massive government spending that of course caused a lot of this inflation with her tie-breaking vote in the Senate. So that that's why Tim Walz hasn't been talking. That's why they're gonna talk together. So they can try to figure it out with the help of each other and so they don't get caught in any contradictions or lies or at least as few as possible. But let's let's take a trip down Dana Bash memory lane because of course this was effectively a an interview awarded to the highest bidder and I'm not talking about bids in terms of currency, money. Talking about bids in terms of what the Kamala Harris campaign thinks that particular interviewer or that particular network offers to Kamala Harris because remember every journalist, every reporter in the country wants this interview. It only went to Dana Bash. Why did it only go to Dana Bash? Well we can take a tour through some of her recent commentary to evaluate how that might play into the interview. Here is a Dana Bash, Dana, Dana, whatever I'm gonna go back and forth between the names. Dana Bash just last week insisting that Donald Trump is actually responsible for the botched Afghanistan withdrawal because the Trump administration actually negotiated the agreement with the Taliban. As you well know the Trump administration negotiated the withdrawal agreement from Afghanistan with the Taliban and the State Department. A conditional agreement and he left Bagram Air Base, he left 2,500 troops, his advisers came to him and said the Taliban haven't lived up to it and he said fine deals off. So actually the botched withdrawal was Trump's fault because Trump tied the hands of Biden with a previously negotiated deal with the Taliban. That would be the point there. Now did the Trump administration negotiate the Afghanistan withdrawal? Yes. Generally speaking they did. Does that absolve Joe Biden from responsibility for the execution of that withdrawal eight months into his presidency? No it does not. Not just because the commander in chief can adjust military strategy at his command, that's part of the job, but because the government or because the agreement rather gave him an escape that he didn't use. If Biden was convinced that the withdrawal was so unwise that we weren't ready to do this and it was too hurried and we had to take more time he could have done that. He had a, not just as he as president can he adjust on the fly if he has to, but under the actual agreement itself he could make changes because the agreement with the Taliban had an escape clause if peace talks with the Afghan government failed. They did fail and Biden already delayed the withdrawal per this agreement from May to September. That was his decision to make. How did he make that change if Trump had tied him up? Why was the withdrawal done the way that it was done? What what was the nature of the September date? Well it was the 20th anniversary of September 11th. Joe Biden wanted the victory lap of having Afghanistan done by the 20 year anniversary and so he just hustled out of there. Of course it cost 13 American lives, we left billions in equipment behind, the Taliban has taken the country over again, all of that so he could have a victory lap that he never took because the whole thing was a disaster. That's uh but but the Dana Bash characterization of the events, Trump did it all, Joe Biden was just following Trump's instructions, okay. Then we have Dana Bash asking or saying that saying that Joe Biden asking why Trump didn't release the Russian hostages like Joe Biden did at the at the start of the month. We had that hostage exchange deal or a prisoner exchange deal with with Russia. Joe Biden came out and said well if Trump thought he could do better why didn't he get them released when uh when he was president and Dana Bash adoringly called that a mic drop moment. President Trump has said repeatedly that he could have gotten the hostages out without giving anything in exchange. What do you say to that? What do you say to President Trump now? Former President. Why didn't he do it when he was president? I think that was um what they call a mic drop moment at the end there. Why didn't he do it when he was president? What uh a historic moment. Yeah uh except for that is completely nonsensical. The reason that uh Donald Trump did not get those prisoners released when he was president is because they were not prisoners when he was president except for one. There's maybe a nugget of truth to there to that statement but three out of the four were not even in prison in Russia at the time. Uh we we had uh the the four people the the four people who were uh secured as a result of the deal. You had uh Wall Street Journal reporter Evan uh Gershkovich, Marine vet Paul Whelan, Russian-American journalist Alsu Kermesheva and Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Russian-British political activist. Uh the one of those four who was actually in Russian prison during Trump's term was Paul Whelan. But the others were arrested in 2022 and 2023. So the answer for why Trump didn't get these people released when he was president is because they were not in prison when Trump was president. But speaking of the question, why didn't you do it when you were president or maybe vice president? Great question for Dana Bash to ask Kamala Harris tomorrow. A great mic drop moments all around if she deploys that question. I hear a lot of lofty promises from you Kamala Harris. Why didn't you do these things during your term as vice president or when you were in the Senate? I look forward to hearing the answers. One more. Uh here is uh Dana Bash in February when the Supreme Court said no the 14th amendment does not require Donald Trump to be kicked off the ballot because of some kooky reading of section three of that amendment. And she said unfortunately for America the Supreme Court got the legal issue right. Look, unfortunately for America the court isn't necessarily wrong that this is the way the framers wanted it to be. They wanted Congress, the people who are closest to their constituents, to be able to make the rules of the laws. Yes, unfortunately for America we have rule of law and voters making decisions. Well the court isn't necessarily wrong. In other words the court is 100% correct on the legal issue. And you know that. Why? Because the Supreme Court made the decision unanimously. It was 9-0. No the 14th amendment does not mean states must kick candidates that Democrats don't like off the ballot. Even the looniest on the court, Sotomayor, Kagan, Jackson, even they had no argument in support of this nonsense which would absolutely remove power from the people. So what exactly is unfortunate when when Dana Bash says that? What is unfortunate? Is it unfortunate that the Supreme Court followed the law and didn't abuse their power to eliminate a candidate that particular people don't like? Is that unfortunate that we had rule of law in that scenario? Is it unfortunate, as she implied there, that that Congress has authority in this matter? Remember that was the Supreme Court decision that enforcing section 3, this insurrectionist clause, or the insurrection clause as they call it, that determining who is and is not an insurrectionist or determining who is and is not qualified is left up to Congress. It's not just for like that that crazy Secretary of State in Colorado or some other random person to decide on a whim. Is that unfortunate that Congress representing the people has authority on this matter? What's unfortunate about that? Or is it just unfortunate because it benefits the candidate that Dana Bash doesn't like? And if that's the case, if that's what she means by unfortunate, oh it works to the benefit of the guy I don't like, how are we supposed to have any faith in this interview coming up tomorrow? What if Dana Bash thinks Kamala Harris looking dumb is unfortunate? Unfortunate for the country. Is she gonna put her own views on the scale? Are they gonna edit the interview to make her look better so that it's more fortunate for her political preferences? I'm not trying to be so cynical here, I just I wish I could hear her explain to me what she means when she says the court got the legal matter right unfortunately for America. Elaborate. Because if you just mean I hate Trump, how am I supposed to put any sort of faith in your objectivity in this interview that's coming up tomorrow? Though of course people would say you don't need to you don't need to say you don't use so many words to say CNN sucks I suppose. Like this is just an over-complicated analysis of what we already knew to be true. CNN was selected for a reason. I think the reason that CNN was selected is because the Kamala Harris campaign wants a network that looks that that is friendly enough not to be a threat to them but not so friendly that it looks like outright propaganda at least some kind of perceive some kind of perception of objectivity and that's why I'm guessing that CNN was the pick. It's friendly enough that they know they're gonna come out looking decent if she if she has the sort of interview that some of her commentary there would suggest but it's not say MSNBC or something like that where critics could say it's it's outright partisan propaganda. Now I do think it's outright partisan propaganda probably but I'm saying they want some plausible deniability for that accusation and one thing I haven't seen any claims to the contrary but I have to wonder especially in the context of a pre-recorded not live interview is it possible that Kamala Harris is gonna have the questions ahead of time? I haven't seen any commentary to say yes or no from CNN or the Kamala Harris campaign and I would like to think that journalistic integrity would compel CNN not to do that however it is CNN and we're talking about the same network that just put up the clips the same reporter that just created the clips that I just played. Is it possible that Kamala Harris is going to have pre recorded answers to this pre-recorded interview like rehearsed answers she knows she even there will be a scripted challenge to her like oh how do you explain this thing it looks like a gotcha question but she actually had it ahead of time to prepare an answer. Again I'm not I'm not saying I have evidence to suggest they're doing that I just wonder given how tightly controlled this is if that's a possibility that this whole thing is is actually scripted or that there's a lot of information exchanged ahead of time and if that was part of the reason why CNN and Dana Bash were selected what was offered I saw reports earlier in the week and I tried to track them down but then I couldn't find them so maybe I was mistaken but I thought the Kamala Harris campaign had said that they were gonna do an interview with a yet-to-be-determined NBC reporter now it's CNN and Dana Bash what changed or am I just mistaken in seeing that report I don't know but again given that every reporter every network in the country wants this interview you have to wonder what terms were offered to secure this interview for CNN and Dana Bash."

No nation, country, or city-state has EVER pushed for a mass foreign invasion! But history IS filled with stories of traitors who opened the gates for foreign invaders. \n\nToday, the US Govt IS that traitor and it knows that its current military (filled with Americans) will not attack its own citizens, especially not on American soil. And this is one of the reasons tens of millions of foreign, fighting aged men have been enticed to flood into America (as well as most western nations). The secret coup needs their own military. To that end, they need the foreigners to enlist en-mass and Americans to unwittingly agree to it. \n\nHow? With war, of course, horrific false flag events, and 24/7 scare-mongering that our military is far too depleted. The foreigners will be offered immediate citizenship upon enlistment and Americans will be offered \u201csafety\u201d, meaning the new U.S. military (once sufficiently populated and trained) will be deployed against the American people. \n\nSomething similar is happening in nearly every western nation. We\u2019re all so distracted by bread and circuses that we're not even noticing the 1984 future speeding towards us, let alone taking action to prepare for it. Fentanyl Floyd, the Summer of Love, BLM/AntiFa, Operation Jade Helm, the Con-vid, these and other events like them are all planned psyops to see how the public reacts and how those reactions can be manipulated.

    "transcript": "Whenever Joe Biden asks whatever incoherent variation of who in God's name needs an assault weapon who in God's name needs a weapon with 100 rounds in a chamber, high capacity chambers still yet to be explained. But one of the many plausible answers is how about the guy who lives in the apartment complex that's now overtaken by the gang of Venezuelan migrants you let into this country, you know, the ones patrolling around with the assault weapons that you hate so much, because this week video showing such an event emerged this scene from the edge at Lowry Apartments in Aurora, Colorado, just east of Denver. And it's not the open carry or the guns themselves that are the problem. Open carry is probably going to be part of the solution, actually. It's the unholstered, threatening carry during the commission of what is alleged to be a forcible entry. Or entry on hostile terms. But don't worry, it's apparently not what it appears to be. In response to Inquiry Wednesday, Governor Jared Polis' spokesperson told the New York Post that the concern over that scene is largely just a feature of the imagination of Aurora City Councilwoman Danielle Jurinski, who's speaking to media about it. What exactly is imagined about that video is unclear, but I guess we're supposed to believe that these guys are just showing up for the friendly neighborhood gun show. And the only actual concern is whether they use the loophole to conduct a private sale without a background check in there. Who knows? The governor's office adds that if the city councilwoman has knowledge of criminal behavior, she should report it to police. And the governor's office is ready to assist with any law enforcement resources necessary. But even if you do think that video is just misunderstood, oh, that's just the boys heading out for an airsoft tournament. That's all. The problem has been reported to police, and police do not say that this is just some imagined threat. They say it's very real, and that is exactly what it appears to be. Aurora police say they are investigating, and the men in this scene are believed to be members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Whatever happened at this particular scene, it was not friendly. This apparent break-in was right before a shootout happened, leaving one person severely injured. And this is by no means a rare or isolated event. Denver has received the most migrants per capita of any major U.S. city. Over 40,000 of them have arrived since the end of 2022, and resource management has been a major problem. The city has limited the amount of time migrants can stay in shelters. They've converted seven hotels into migrant shelters, and they've coordinated with landlords to use apartment complexes like this one to house migrants. And despite all the effort and the tens of millions of public dollars spent, it still was not good enough. Massive migrant homeless camps moved in. They said the accommodations were a slap in the face. And this spring, migrants, through their activist allies, issued a list of demands to city government. The camp, as a collective, came up with a list of demands. There have been so many complaints about the food being spoiled or not being enough. They're not receiving any kind of official housing or immigration document support, which is incredibly necessary for them to be able to navigate the bureaucracy around these systems. Which, of course, isn't even the full extent of the absurdity. The city then agreed to provide even more in response. OK, lo siento. We'll throw in some extra nights on your hotel stay, plus HBO and the Continental Breakfast, too. Now, a large portion of these incoming migrants are Venezuelan. So, of course, with a mostly unvetted Venezuelan influx, that's how you get the Venezuelan gang. And this gang, Tren de Aragua, has now taken over or otherwise harassed tenants at several Aurora apartment buildings. In fact, at this same apartment complex in July, the gang's leader, known by the nickname \"Galleta\" or \"Cookie\" in English, was arrested for severely beating a man outside the building. The man had apparently confronted Cookie and half a dozen of his friends. During the dispute, Cookie informed the man that his gang runs the place. They run Walmart, too, they said, from which they regularly steal, according to the affidavit. One female witness told police this has been ongoing, but she's reluctant to talk to police for fear of retaliation from the dangerous people like Cookie and the Crumbles, who live in the complex. And she's probably very wise to be afraid. Was Cookie swiftly deported? Was he even held in custody pending trial? No, of course not. He was released and he's probably deliberating about how exactly he wants to harm this woman and other snitches very soon. But OK, if that video is not what it appears to be and the police investigation is mistaken, too, it's all just imaginary, the governor says. Well, how about we consider the perspective of the people who provided that video, too? Where did that video come from? It came from Edward and Cindy Romero, former tenants at this apartment complex who have now escaped. Speaking with a local reporter after providing that video, Cindy said living there has been a nightmare and she couldn't wait to get out. She showed the reporter how she has her whole door lined with locks top to bottom, so it's harder to kick down. She says a shootout riddled her car with bullet holes earlier this month. The Romeros are not migrants themselves. They say that the problems in this apartment community began when the migrants arrived, though. They've had trouble finding help to get to a new, safer place to live. And the supposedly imaginative Aurora City Councilwoman, Danielle Jarinski, who's been helping them, says there's a terrible irony that the city's nonprofits are mostly lining up to help the migrants, not the Americans who have been victimized and trapped in these buildings. And there's a further irony still that much of the crime and harassment is migrant on migrant, too. The city councilwoman says other Venezuelans are being extorted by this gang. So at this rate, deportation will be the asylum, actually. And yet, despite the overwhelming evidence, \"control your imagination, please,\" is the advice of the governor. And to that theme, the Aurora and Denver mayors are teaming up to warn you of the dangers of overreacting or exaggerating the story, too. \"Do not create hysteria,\" they say. See, the problem is actually you seeing that video and then being proactive in trying to prevent similar situations. It's overwhelming our 911 system, our emergency call center. And so it's actually hurting our ability to respond to crime. And so I would hope people would not do that. I think we're we're in some sort of environment of hysteria. The threat from TDA in Denver, it's smaller than many other organized criminal networks that might have been here for decades. The ones, you know, like the Bloods or the Crips or others. Please do not call 911 about the Venezuelan gangs because we need the lines open for calls about other gangs, too. That's almost as nonassuring as the Denver mayor's call to remember the real victims of this scenario. The newcomers themselves. The risk on this is the folks most likely to be taken advantage of and abused by this are other newcomers or Venezuelans who have arrived and are being bullied by these individuals and feel afraid to call the police or call the city. After all, the biggest danger is that you might have the wrong opinion about them, which would somehow hurt them even more than the gangs do. Ow, right in the feelings. The much bigger risk is that you'll have a perception that all of the newcomers in the city are dangerous and nothing could be farther from the truth. So at this rate, if you're a hostage in an Aurora apartment building and you need some help, you have a few possible options. You could learn to speak Spanish and call 911 pretending to be Venezuelan. You may get some relief then, or you can just patiently wait for blood or Crip reinforcements to arrive for the gang war to liberate the complex for America once again, or move into a tent down by the train tracks and send a demand to the city for a nicer house. Instead, that one can work. But again, I think you got to wear brownface to qualify or just take the governor's advice. The most realistic option of them all. Just exercise that overactive imagination of yours to create a different scenario altogether. Do you really live in a crime ridden hellscape overrun by a foreign gang? Or do you actually live in a tropical island paradise or a space station on the moon or maybe in a castle high atop a majestic mountain peak? See, just like a little kid, your cardboard box of an apartment can be anything you want it to be. It's all in your mindset. Just don't forget the extra locks on your door and be sure to seal up those bullet holes before winter, too. Thanks, as always, for listening and for supporting Tenet Media.

That lie is that you are something separate and apart from the world outside your head. That is the illusion. The objective truth is its all one thingy E=MC^2 < All one thingy.\n\nThe measurement problem is so much bigger than you are told. Our science is founded upon the illusion of self and consequentially we see everything in relativistic terms and measure them accordingly. Hence, the theory of relativity is a fine description of our cognitive simulated reality as seen and measured in our egotistic mind set. For the truth of the matter is, and anyone can test this, there is no left or right side of any space. Such measurements are egocentrically founded. This would also mean there is no in or out or up and down. All geometry becomes null and void.\n\nFrom our lowly disposition there is only one thing from base reality that seeps through. And that is the unquestionable understanding of certainty. For all intent and purpose this sense of unquestionable & unconditional certainty is God. As the biblical fellow pointed out it is the indispensable part of things, for without any certainty/reality/God/truth/validity/actuality you do not logically exist outside of a state of nothingness. And, to drive home the point that this certainty is indispensable, even nothingness cannot be nothingness unless the nothingness is absolutely certain.\n\nEvery argument calls upon the truth to back it up.

    "transcript": "There's this ongoing joke that \u2014 there's two, actually. One is, I don't know, at some point in 2016, the Large Hadron Collider in Europe fired up and shattered reality, accidentally making Donald Trump the president, and now we're trapped in some strange fragmented universe where nothing quite makes sense. And you have the Mandela Effect and all that. But the other joke is that there are writers who are writing everything that's going on. And people often say the writers of season two are rehashing old ideas or whatever that may be. But what's funny about this is, the joke behind all of it is that certainly we live in a constructed reality of some sort, because it is much too interesting right now with everything that's going on. I have to make the point that we've lived through, I don't know, what, 50 historical moments this year alone? I don't know if 50 is the right number, but at least in the past decade, it's been some substantial number. You've got never-before-a-candidate-with-no-policy-positions-put-in-a-few-months-in-advance, the former president was nearly assassinated. You've got January 6th. I mean, just the list is crazy. So perhaps it's actually quite simple. We live in reality. Everything is what it is. And it's just the internet has sped up the rate of communication, resulting in it feeling like history is smashing us in the face. Or perhaps this is all part of God's plan and something significant is happening, and we are here and facing a test. Or additionally, we're in a simulation and people are watching. Now I like the idea that we're in a simulation and we're just entertainment for some species somewhere else, just watching and enjoying the show and laughing that Donald Trump is president. But we're going to have a big conversation about religion, spirituality, simulation theory, all of these things. And so we've got a couple of guests who are joining us. I don't know if you want to go first, Roman, introduce yourself. Sure. I'm Roman Jempolsky. I'm faculty at the university. I do research on computer science, artificial intelligence, superintelligence, cyber security. So simulation is kind of a small subtopic within that bigger, very interesting framework. And do you believe we are in a simulation? Oh, we're definitely in a simulation. This is going to be fun. And then Brian, how about you? Well, my name is Brian Sauve, and I am a Christian pastor out in Ogden, Utah, of a church called Refuge Church. It's a Protestant Reformed Church, and I'm also the founder and president of a publishing company called New Christendom Press, where I release music, finishing a book, and most importantly for this conversation, do a couple podcasts. One of them is called Haunted Cosmos, where my co-host Ben Garrett and I talk about the intersection of Christian theology with high strangeness, allegedly supernatural phenomena, government conspiracy, and anything else that interests us, because we can do whatever we want, it's our show. And we talk a lot about materialism and its failure as an explanatory mechanism for the world and that sort of thing, so really interested in this topic. Super cool, man. Well, I'm Ian Crossland, here to join, and I agree with you, like, matter, when you talk about materialism and, like, matter. At what point is matter, like, after plasma, there's something is still going on, but it's just non-material. And I've been thinking a lot about, like, remote viewing lately, and it's real. And the CIA works on remote viewing, and, like, it has to do with quantum entanglement. Are we talking about subatomic phenomenon, or is there something that's just literally beyond the physical realm as we know it? But let's\u2014 So we're gonna get into it, and then also Ian is here, and for a couple reasons. Ian has long questioned spirituality and existence on TimCast IRL, and many people often ask him to sit down with learned men who can help him better understand the nature of reality. And so I figure Ian adds that wildcard element and the questions of all of these things, which will be rather interesting. But where should we begin, I suppose? I saw\u2014you were mentioned online in a tweet where you said something to the effect of, \"It's too interesting right now.\" And that is evidence that we are living in a simulation. How so? I mean, I think we all get it, but let's start there. Why does that make you think we're living in a simulation? That's a great question, and people question it. They tell me, \"No, no, no, it's not the most interesting times. People always believe that, you know, somebody invented fire, invented wheel. It's gonna be interesting in that way.\" The difference is we're hitting meta-interesting stuff. We're starting to create intelligence, so a requirement for having simulations, and we're starting to create realistic simulations. So that's two meta-factors. If I was running ancestral simulations, I would be interested in that time frame. This is where it's, \"Who's gonna create superintelligence? Will they be able to control it? Can they tell the real world from fake world, setting up ethics for future simulations?\" This is the interesting times, not the fire. But I think if we're gonna base it off of\u2014there's a lot more to break down in simulation theory too, especially. But if we're gonna base, you know, what's happening now and what's interesting, if we're gonna use that as a basis for why we're in a simulation, I honestly just default to, we are entertainment. And if we as a civilization were to create simulations, what would they be for? Sure, I guess universities are running simulations, I guess, but that's probably a tiny, tiny fraction of the simulations that exist. So we have plethora, probably tens of thousands of different simulations that exist in video games, emulated reality for a variety of reasons, and it is only a small fraction of these simulated realities that actually exist as some kind of research. I think it stands to reason that we exist in some kind of entertainment. And I think the first thing we are probably going to do with AI, why make TV shows anymore? Why hire crews and cameras and lighting and writers when we can just create a million different AI simulated realities and then let a decentralized network figure out what is the most interesting one to watch. And you've got a bunch of weird alien creatures, or even humans, sitting at their computers and they're all hitting the like button on Earth 2024. And this one dude sitting in his pod eating roaches, and he's like, \"Guys, guys, Donald Trump became president in this one!\" And then everyone starts watching. And so it seems to me that if we are in a simulation, it's probably more likely entertainment than research. You know, anecdotally, I vape DMT for the first time in my life, and I witnessed these creatures. First of all, I just saw spiraling shape patterns, like the letter A, the letter F on its side, like a triangle. And they were like ribbons of patterns of numbers and shapes. And then these ribbons became three-dimensional moving around. Then it became the outline of this woman's arm, and she was waving me towards her. And then I allowed the visualization to continue. And then all of a sudden, it was like three beings, this woman, this male being. They were like shimmering light. And they saw me, and they were highly entertained. This is part of when you're saying that you think it's entertainment for some other sort of being. I think you might be right. And they were fascinated that I could see them. They were like elated that I could see them. It was like a video game character that realizes it's a video game character. And I was the video game character for them. I don't know if it was just pure hallucination. I'm not the only one that's talked about this kind of thing either. And it wasn't like I wanted to experience that. That's just what happened after I puffed the stuff. All right, Brian, help us out. Well, that's really it. We did an episode on DMT in Ayahuasca. And I think it's interesting how it relates to the simulation concept. Because I do think that all of you are noticing something that is true. As a cultural phenomenon, even. I think that you guys are noticing that this world does not just seem to be a sort of accidental collision of a bunch of stuff that's roiling around. And that there is some sort of meaning behind reality. There's some sort of mind behind reality. There's some sort of designing, architecting, arch storyteller behind reality. And that you can engage with consciousness that is not just human. I think all of that's true. However, I believe that that story is much better-- all of that data is much better explained not by a simulation, which I actually think might be a formally self-contradictory idea. An idea that if it's true it can't be true, but that it's better explained by the classical understanding of the Christian God. That we do live in a story, not a simulation is how I'd put it, that's being told by God. And that He is all-powerful, all-good, and all-wise, all the omnis. And He's therefore able to, when He tells a story, it's not just words on a page like when we tell a story, as His sub-creators made in His image, but it's actually real, and it has extension in space, and even establishes the validity of second causes, and allows for real will and real freedom. Which is another thing that I think simulation theory would obliterate, would be the possibility of human freedom and the reality of human will. I think it would end up being a deterministic world where all meaning is destroyed, and even the possibility of justified and rational knowledge. So\u2014 You're saying if we are in a simulation, that is? Yeah. I think if we're in a simulation, then knowledge is impossible for many, many different reasons. And actually, not just knowledge, but especially rational and justified knowledge and belief would be impossible. But why would it be impossible? So think about it like this. If you're in a simulation, how do we arrive at knowledge? Well, we deploy our senses, sense data, and we deploy reason. So we look at our sense data and we compare it to what seem to be necessary abstract objects like the laws of logic, the law of non-contradiction. And in a simulation, backing up, I would say that in order for a person to reason in a way that would be rationally justified, he actually has to believe that his mechanisms for data input and analysis of that data is reliable. However, if we live in a simulation, then both of those things are destroyed. Because all of our sense data is actually deceiving us. It's making us believe something that's not true. And I also think on a meta-level\u2014and this is really more of a philosophical question than a technological question\u2014but I think that on the meta-level, it can't actually account for things like abstract objects, like the laws of logic, laws of mathematics, moral realities, things like that, unless somewhere in the simulation, even if you went to base reality and you asked the question of, \"Is base reality a meat space like people joke about in Minecraft, meat space? Is it like us, like what we think we are? Or is it itself a transcendent reality?\" And at some point, you have to reason back to where did this come from? What's behind it? So it accounts for those abstract moral objects and abstract laws of logic. And on that end, I think you still have to posit God at the bottom of the simulation. How do you define God? But let me\u2014yeah. Well, yeah, let's\u2014yeah. So God is a necessary being. He's a non-contingent being. Unlike us, we're contingent beings. Even if simulation theory is true, this is true. We exist contingently, meaning we don't have to exist, and we exist because of some other thing that upholds it. So God is a self-existent, necessary being who is maximally good in every way, and therefore he's timeless, changeless, immensely powerful, and he exists outside of his creation, and yet is imminent in his creation. I would say that all things exist within God. All things are not God. I'm not a panentheist, but they exist within. I don't see this as being contradictory to simulation theory. Yeah, if\u2014you know, often Seamus Coghlan and I, when we would discuss these things, we would say simulation theory seems to be a sci-fi labeling of religious theory in a lot of ways. And so what you were saying about knowledge not being possible, I can't agree and disagree, but so I'll explain. Knowledge of the existence beyond the simulation would be impossible. You could only know an experience what the simulation was designed to allow you to know an experience, but that could be stated exactly as, if the universe is a construct of God, you can only know an experience what God has allowed within this reality for you to know an experience. You know, Ian talks about machine elves and experiencing these things, and those are still within the realm of human perception and consciousness. I would love to talk more about that, too, at some point. Yeah, absolutely. But I hear these stories about, you know, past near-death experiences where people feel like there's a giant ball of energy that they're drifting towards or something to this effect. Yeah, the sun. Maybe, maybe. But there are certainly things beyond our comprehension, and if God does exist outside of this construct, then we can't know what exists or even fathom what is God or what God exists, you know, what is the realm of God. I see those as just different ways of describing the same thing, be it simulation or otherwise. And Tim, that's a really good point, actually, that even in Christian theology, what we would say, two things we would say, is that man is limited in his ability to comprehend and apprehend, but he was created by a creator for something, and so he's fitted for the duties to which he was created. Same as simulation. So he's fitted to understanding the world. However, we can't know God apart from God's divine self-revelation, which he unfolds through creation, which we theologians call the book of nature. We do observe things about the world, and we make inferences to best conclusions from the evidence, things like that. We were fitted for that sort of work, and the universe is knowable. But it's only knowable, I would say, if God is upholding those things. For example, like to justify that statement somewhat, I would say, why would we expect for physical brain states to have anything to do with something like objective truth? Why would we expect for the brain states of a highly evolved primate to have anything to do with a correct apprehension of the fundamental reality in which we live? Why would we\u2014how is matter about anything? How does matter have intentionality? How can matter know anything? There's secular answers to this. I don't believe any of them are compelling, just to be frank. But I think there are attempts at ascending the\u2014essentially building a sandcastle from the first grain of sand being just starting with mere stuff, and then spinning out theoretical models where we could account for human consciousness, justify true belief, abstract objects existing like mathematical laws and the laws of logic and moral laws. However, I think those things are as uncompelling as if you were to ask an archaeologist, explain this ancient manuscript that you found out in Dead Sea Scrolls, out in a pot somewhere. But here's the rule, you're not allowed to appeal to the existence of any intelligence in doing so. Now, could I develop an elaborate story as a human being with an elaborate consciousness to be able to say, well, there was some reeds and they dried up and there was an earthquake and it crushed them up and it created a powder and water reconstituted it and it fell between two flat rocks and made a paper, and then a beetle crawled through a fire and he, you know, put some strange markings across it, and I don't know, it's like, of course. If on the level of the rules you rule out the existence of a cosmic intelligence, what Chalmers in his book Reality Plus, talking about some of this stuff, he calls the cosmic god rather than the simulator god, well then of course human beings will come up with some story to explain it, because that's what we do. But I just think the story we'll end up telling will be extremely ad hoc, and it won't have the same explanatory value for the things that creator, cosmic god can explain, you know, much more simply and with much less ad hoc reasoning. >>Roman, do you want to explain your view on the simulation that we're in, its purpose, existence, who made it? >>Sure. So, you cover so much interesting material, I'm like, I want to comment on every part of it. But I think I agree with all of you just on different components. So you're asking, what is the purpose of a simulation? You cannot know from insight, and that's to your point, you're absolutely correct. Whatever you are given is inside of this virtual world. You don't know what's happening outside unless you are given privileged access to that external world. So from insight we can also consider things like maybe it's educational, maybe it's testing, maybe it's some reason we cannot comprehend because we are not smart enough. I know what it is. Keep going, I'll tell you in a second. >>Awesome. So we need to either break out of a simulation, hack to the outside world and get real knowledge, or we just figure out kind of based on properties of human abilities. We have brains, we have bodies, what can you do with those things? And then we're starting to see, okay, we are capable of creating other intelligent beings. We are capable of creating simulated worlds. So maybe that's going to teach us about some of those answers. To me, it's very simple. We are on the verge of creating real artificial intelligence, not a tool, an agent as capable as any human being, perhaps smarter than all human beings, super intelligence. Then a being like that runs simulations, just it's thinking about future states of the world. It creates very realistic states inside of its mind, millions of them, billions of them. Some of those internal states, thoughts about other agents, about humans. If you do it in enough detail, you essentially have this world. You're thinking about lots of people who are conscious agents in the world making decisions. Maybe it's predicting economic states of the world, maybe political outcomes. But this is what you do. You run simulations and you think, well, this guy will do this and this group of people will do that. If it's at high enough fidelity, this is what you're getting. Lots and lots of simulated worlds with possibly conscious beings. We can talk about what that means to be conscious, but this is basically my belief. I think we're getting to the point where we have this technology and we can do it in the future. But here's the most interesting aspect of it. If anyone's questioning whatever its simulation, let's say in 10 years, 20 years, technology to run realistic simulations is available to me. It's affordable and it's so high quality you can't tell. I pre-commit right now to run millions of simulations at this exact moment, placing you statistically in one of those simulations. So even if right now there is still low statistical chance of it, eventually you are guaranteed to be in a virtual world. Right. That's one of the most common arguments that you hear for simulation theory and one of the earlier ones that became popular. The fact that we can right now, literally in our reality, create these simulations and we're getting to the point where it's going to be indistinguishable, especially with something like Neuralink, then the likelihood is greater that you're in a simulation than you are not. And that's why a lot of people believe this. But let me give you one thing. So I was thinking about Terminator, right? We've all seen that Skynet goes and just decides to wipe out humanity. And I think that's an absurdity. The idea that we would make an AI and then it would be like, and now I will go to war with humans is stupid. We create an AI, it's going to need humans to perform labor to sustain itself along with its other mechanized components. It would probably seek to control and utilize humans. And in that, the incentive of the AI would actually be to keep humans docile and happy. So you'd probably get a, the AI would create simulations or entertainment or things to keep humans perpetuating or providing its own services. But in thinking about that, I said, how do you avoid a Terminator scenario in developing AI? If we were to create an AI program and we're trying to get to artificial general intelligence, the point at which it looks and can behave exactly as a human way beyond human capabilities, but to a human, they wouldn't know the difference. That's a lot of work and a lot of risk. You unleash something like that into human civilization and you may end up with a sociopath that wants to make everything just corn. You know, the AI's incentive may simply be maximizing, you know, the most efficient path to human gratification. And in the United States, we subsidize corn to an insane degree. We do so much with it that the AI may do something ridiculous and just be like, there's no point in dealing with anything else. But if the score is corn production generates a, you know, plus 17 result, and then- - Corn is everything. - It's everything. - Corn is God. - Because it's possible the AI just looks at all things as it is able to analyze and says assigns a value to each based on whether something is a positive or negative reaction for humans. I'm not saying corn is it. I'm saying it could be something as absurd as it just goes, humans love subsidizing and producing this product. And so it just redirects society in that direction. And then before we realize it, we live in crackpot corn reality. But so I was thinking about this, how do you avert evil or broken AI? Well what I would do is I would create a simulated reality in which each AI iteration exists as a conscious entity beginning with zero knowledge, and it would simulate a human life, this artificial intelligence, and all seven or 8 billion would experience various types of life that it could live. And the AI constructs that are within each individual within this one simulation interacting with each other, each one that is evil, malicious, or insane would be deleted and removed. Each that was studious, industrious, and capable would advance to an Android body outside of the simulation. And so if I was seeking to create robots that would serve humanity, an Android that will clean my living room or create nuclear energy or run power plants or do good governance, I would not want evil, I would not want sociopathic or fractured. I would want empathetic, studious, intelligent, pragmatic. So I would run all of the iterations of AI through a simulation. Those that are bad, I would delete, just, you're gone. And those that are good would advance to live in my kingdom and with me forever. So what do you, here's the problem. Have you ever done bad things? Done bad, I guess. Yeah, no, exactly. Can you? What is evil? I define evil as those things that are destructive and in furtherance of chaos. That's overly simplistic. I think the problem that I would see with this kind of idea is that what you run into is that all human beings are evil. Even by that, have you ever contributed to chaos and destruction? I disagree. I think it's oversimplified. All humans have the capability of evil. Like yin and yang, within good there is evil, within evil there is, or I should say within good there is the capability of evil, within evil there's the capability of good. But when I look at the bigger picture of what evil and good is, I would describe good as things that organize energy into complex systems. And again, that's overly simplistic. It would take a long time if we actually went through all the, to break it down. And I look at evil as things that serve entropic ends. Life is a form of negative entropy, and we can only create more in its wake. Negative entropy only exists so long as we create more entropy as the universe pushes towards chaos. That being said, in the service of good, you can destroy. In the service of evil, you can create. Yeah, fire is neutral, but fire can destroy. Chaotic and destructive, but it can be very good. It's one of the most important things that humans have ever discovered, how to essentially, I don't want to say produce, but perhaps produce, but to ignite, allow, as we're able to then refine elements and develop technology through our ability with combustion. Can I give you a thought experiment? I think it's really interesting on this front, because it overlaps quite a bit with ethics, with Christian theology. What is the good, and how do we know it? Imagine that through your entire life you wore a recording device that was able to capture every thought you had that was a moral law, or every statement you ever made of moral truth. For example, you're driving through traffic, and somebody cuts you off, and you say, \"What an idiot.\" And it somehow knows and can translate, \"Okay, people who do X action are bad and wicked.\" And we established the Bible of Brian. So my own deuteronomic law, my own Mosaic law, thus says Brian, \"This is the good, and this is the evil.\" Now, if you had a super intelligent being that was able to even read my brain states, I'm not a functional material, I don't believe that the brain alone is the mind, but let's assume that it is, and it could read all of my mind and thoughts, and look at all of my actions, and dispassionately compare me to my own stated law, what would it find? Well, it would find that I violated every single one of even my own\u2014and my laws would be imperfect\u2014but it would find that I violated even every single one of my own imperfect laws. Now, let's maximize this to all of humanity, and we were to try and come up with some sort of law that the A.I. is going to compare people to and say, \"I'm going to delete people who are bad.\" This is more what I mean\u2014 It's not an A.I. doing it. Or not a consciousness. It's a God. It's a God. God, when you die, the God looks at your life chart and says, \"Okay, we've got Brian 7369412, what did he do?\" He's actually a pretty good dude. He did some bad stuff, you know, I think he stole a bag of chips when he was a teenager, but we don't really care about that. He learned his lesson, he went on to be a good man, a family man. He was logical, he was intelligent. I think this is a good, good guy. We definitely want this entity to work with us and live and experience. And so the bad exists, but a reasonable\u2014if it were me, and I was going through a list of various iterations of artificial intelligences, and I saw yours in there, certainly I would see bad things you've done, but the question is, are you just in general going to be a good person? And the answer is yes, then you get to come live in my, you know, super-reality world. Let me address your proposal for AI safety, I think that's what you proposed. In early stages, you're right, AI needs us for manufacturing, for whatever production of next-generation system. But eventually, you have nothing to contribute to superintelligence. It can develop physical bodies, robots, it can solve nanotechnology, it can do synthetic biology to generate whatever resources or services you provide. So A, it doesn't need us, and B, if it's already at that level of capability, it doesn't need to try and evolve slightly more intelligent AIs through generations. It already supersedes that level to begin with, so it cannot be an approach to generate safer agents. Well, so I disagree that it doesn't need us. If you're going to create\u2014the robots that we build are pathetic compared to us. If we wanted to make\u2014actually, it's a\u2014what is it, Blade Runner? And Fallout 4 talks about this. You had, in Blade Runner, replicants, and then in Fallout 4 you have synths. In the Fallout series, synthetic humans first are robots with metal arms and faces, and they have AI to communicate, but they're pretty dumb. In Fallout 4\u2014this is a video game, by the way\u2014the synths are effectively genetically engineered androids, because the structure of human bone and muscle and development and self-replication is much more efficient than a factory producing robots. So I agree with you halfway. It doesn't need us as free will, independent entities. It would need to create docile, dependent humans that self-replicate but stay within the confines of what it requires. So that means someone to mine cobalt, so that it can use the cobalt for certain things. It's going to need\u2014we can make the argument that it needs\u2014no, it'll just make a robot to do it. We are that robot. Why build from scratch this strange little creature with fine-tuned little motors that can\u2014when it can make a human that can juggle? And the humans make themselves, so there's no factories. The humans collect free energy, reproduce themselves, and as long as the AI controls the culture, society, and the knowledge of these creatures, it will\u2014they will do the dirty work to help sustain itself. It would make a lot more sense to have direct control. So you have superintelligence, you have eight billion bodies, control it directly. Why go through 20 years of learning from scratch? Why give you choice not to perform useful work? It's not an efficient way to do it. I agree. And a human body is definitely not an efficient way to colonize the universe, to accomplish things in extreme environments. It can do much better. Robots today, you're right, I agree, are garbage. But just like AI was garbage 10 years ago, look at the exponential progress. And if AI is doing research, maybe five years later you have something more capable. What about emotion? Because AI talks a lot about intelligence, but then we've got\u2014like, there's IQ and there's EQ. There's intelligent, you know, but\u2014and robots have high intelligence, but they have no emotion, as far as I can tell. And I don't know if we'll ever be able to\u2014like, can an advanced quantum computer simulate emotion? I don't think it can, personally. Is it necessary? Well, I don't know. I don't even know technically how do you even define emotion to move forward? Like, what propels the machine? If a goal is manufacturing, you don't want emotional workers. You want hardworking, intelligent workers. You can simulate emotion. Can they internally experience those? That's a different question. That's a very philosophical question. You can't know from outside what the internal quality is. And I think that's an actually important question about AI at all, is the question of what is consciousness, and is generative AI actually\u2014card's on the table. I don't believe that it's capable of achieving consciousness, properly defined, because I don't think that that's actually a metaphysical possibility. I think generative AI\u2014like, are you familiar with Dr. Selmer Bringsjord? Yes. Okay, so he's talked about this quite a bit, and he's developed even, I think, a paper. It's fairly technical, but he has a lengthy paper that's actually an argument for the existence of God, a novel argument for the existence of God on the basis of AI, which is really interesting. I couldn't do it justice, but it's something like, if you were to take the best that we can do with AI and put it in a robot and all that stuff, and then look at it and compare it to human consciousness, you would be forced to ask the question of human consciousness, \"Well, where did all of the other stuff come from? All the stuff that's not in that, where did it come from?\" Because there's\u2014 What stuff? You know, we're talking about here with, like, will. The ability of justified true belief. These sorts of things, I don't even think they're possible. Like the Searles Chinese Room, I've never been satisfactorily convinced that claiming that the system knows Chinese evades the force of that objection. What's that? The Chinese Room is a thought experiment. It's an old one, and you might know more about it than I do, but it's an old thought experiment that basically attempts to simulate in an understandable way to a person what's happening in a computer. And so it imagines that there's a room in which you put an English-speaking man, and the English-speaking man, he has a somehow exhaustive volume of rules that teach him in Chinese characters\u2014explained in English, but with Chinese characters\u2014to explain what to respond with when certain symbols come through a slot on the door in paper. So a Chinese speaker outside of the room puts a piece of paper in the slot with a Chinese sentence on it, or paragraph, or whatever. And it takes a really long time, because he's slow, he's a human, he's not a computer. But he compares it to his book of rules, and he, you know, responds with the ideograms, the Chinese ideograms that the rules tell him to respond with, and he puts it out of the slot to the Chinese speaker. And the Chinese speaker assumes that the person in there is having a conversation with him or her, and knows what they're saying. But he doesn't. He has no idea the content of the Chinese sentence that he received or responded with. And Searle's point was, this is analogous to a computer, or even, I think, neural networks, any kind of computing, is going to be able, through rules and input and training and datasets that we put in, it's going to be able to formulate responses and, through reward structures, is towards beating a simple Turing test kind of thing. But it doesn't actually know Chinese. It doesn't know what it's doing. >>This is actually interesting. Without a point of reference for what any of these symbols represent, then the individual \u2014 I think it's easier to explain with math than with Chinese. A guy's in a room, and there's a bunch of weird symbols he doesn't understand. Someone feeds in a set of symbols, he looks at it, he looks at his book, and says, \"When you look at these symbols, then you get these symbols back.\" He doesn't know what any of the symbols represent. At any point, however, if the individual in the room is told, \"This one symbol means 'dog',\" that is enough for the person to start mapping out what the words actually do mean and understanding it. The question then is, would a computer ever have the ability to be given one point of reference for what one of the words actually means? And I think the answer is no. >>So for a Turing test to be passed, you should be able to answer some novel questions. If you have a fixed set of rules, you can never do anything novel, so that's a limitation. Interestingly, large language models present a good experimental evidence that just from symbols, just from text, you can learn about other modalities. Trained on text, they were able to produce visuals. With programming language, they would create pictures and could answer questions about that 2D or even 3D world in visual space. So clearly there is some limits to the Chinese room argument. >>I think the Chinese room argument and the point of it, and again, like I'm a Christian theologian here. I'm not an AI expert with Dr. Jampolsky's decades in the field, and I could not sit down and explain front to back how to build a neural network. So I'm not trying to claim technical expertise beyond my knowledge. What I'm more interested in is the philosophical question of the mind and consciousness, where I don't think\u2014people, I think, mistake the human brain for the mind, that the mind is just a result of physical processes in the brain, like a machine physicalist view of the\u2014machine functionalism view of the brain. I would actually\u2014and we were talking about music before we recorded\u2014I would compare the mind, I think, more accurately to a player of an instrument, where the neural network of the brain is a phenomenally complex and balanced instrument, and yet it is played by the immaterial mind and soul. I don't think matter can be about\u2014I don't think it can actually produce mind. I don't think it can produce consciousness, even on a metaphysical level. So I would say that, you know, like, can you change someone's personality by poking a hole in their brain? Yeah, in the same way that if you start drilling holes in my guitar while I'm playing, it will change and ultimately destroy the capability of the instrument to make music. But the instrument's not making the music, the person is. That's interesting, that's like, that the mind is actually a bunch of interfering resonations. So like, I was thinking of what is collective consciousness, and it seems like your body starts to vibrate and produce what you think of as thought. That vibration produces a resonating field, which causes other bodies to start to vibrate, which then they begin to produce their own resonation fields, which cause other bodies to vibrate, and so on. You've got all these different\u2014and we think of our thoughts as our own, but often I think they're within other fields, and then I start to wonder, okay, what's the difference between consciousness and sentience? Is that like, can these fields of resonance be sentient, but only when they interact with matter, do they become conscious? Yeah. I mean, I think you can create, obviously, generative AI that gives extraordinarily convincing illusion of sentience, of self-awareness, and of consciousness. I think the Turing test could be passed by weak AI, in the sense of fooling a human. We got GPT pulled up, and I've been punching these questions into it. There you go. We'll see what it thinks. But no, I think you could do that, and fool a person with some of these things, but I think it would yet remain that what it's doing is it's generating on a very complicated, and actually beyond our ability to understand\u2014I think it's important to understand that\u2014that AI is doing things that are beyond the human ability to understand and how they're interacting with data sets, but they're still interacting with data sets on the basis of rules that are input by conscious beings. I just want to add one thing, too, as we're talking about consciousness, sentience, and Turing tests. There was a game that was made where it's a human or AI. It connects you with a random person or an AI, and the goal is for both of you to talk to each other, and then afterwards, after like 30 seconds or whatever it says, was this an AI or a human? And I think what a lot of these sci-fi writers did not predict is that, actually, the humans are going to pretend to be AI. And so what ended up happening with this game, I don't know about most people, but a lot of people played the game with the intention of trying to pass themselves off as an AI to trick the other human. So that\u2014 >>That's funny. >>Yeah. >>See, that's human creativity at work there. >>Yeah. Can we build trying to emulate what the AI would say? And they would do it by\u2014 >>Beep, boop, beep. >>Well, no, I mean, humans will use shorthand, acronyms, slang terms. The AI might pick it up. But AI responses are very constructed. So if you said\u2014someone would type in, \"How do I know that you're a human?\" And a human would be like, \"Because you're effing dumb, idiot.\" >>It would troll you. >>No, like a human is going to say something like, \"IDK, I just had a cheeseburger from McDonald's with extra mac sauce. I guess that makes me human.\" The AI would say, \"That's an interesting question. It's hard for me to decide what to respond with in order to convince you that I am a human.\" So when, as a human, you answer in this formulaic, robotic way, they say, \"Ah, you're an AI. Wrong.\" >>Yeah. To dispel the roboticism, like, can you build intelligent systems that vibrate and cause resonation fields that self-interfere to allow for a sort of consciousness to develop? Can you explain what he's saying? >>Sometimes it's good to say, \"I don't know anything about this topic. I have no opinions of things I'm not an expert in. I think part of problems in society is that everyone claims expertise in everything. I know nothing about this.\" >>Like, have you worked on building artificial intelligence systems before? >>I mean, I'm an artificial intelligence researcher. I teach AI. I don't work on cutting-edge AI. I think it's unethical to build it. >>Have you noticed differences in the structure of the system that the intelligence is within to change the function of the intelligence itself? Like if it's in a quasicrystal or if it's in, like, the shape of a triangle, does it function different if it's in the shape of a square? >>I don't even know what this refers to. >>Like, if you built, like, a spherical crystal that contains the AI, would it function differently in a triangular crystal? >>Does the function of an AI perform differently within different types of computers or... >>It's substrate-independent. We can run it on meat. We can run it on silicon. We can run it on quantum computers. It doesn't matter. We can encode the same algorithms. >>Oh, so whatever it's in, they can make it do the same thing? >>What makes us human is that our substrate, the differential in our substrate changes the way we act. And, like, if these things are the same across substrates, that would forever differentiate them from human or animal, I would think, unless we could figure out how to. >>So give some credit to this. We do believe that quantum computers would have capabilities that Neumann machines do not. There is some degree of belief that certain substrates have more capabilities, and some people equate quantum weirdness with consciousness and with related states. >>That's pretty interesting. >>So here's the question I have for you, Ian, and I suppose, actually, for the panel. Is this, you know, what Ian is basically asking, in a very weird way, is the structure of the machine itself, be it its shape or its components, will that change the way the computer operates? And you're saying that whatever the algorithm is, it can operate in any substrate. >>Right. But here's what we are getting to. Once you have human-level capability, you can make artificial scientist, artificial engineer, and so you start self-modification, self-improvement process, where the system you build is not the system two, three, four generations later. And if it's good enough, what it creates is already out of your control, and you cannot predict or explain what's going to happen. So it may be very successful at engineering much more capable systems. Humans take time. They sleep. They eat. They get sick. This system needs none of that, and it works at higher speeds. So what we see typically take two years to see the next generation of large language models. Maybe it will take two months, two weeks, two days. So you have this exponential explosion of intelligence. >>Let me, I want to pull up this image we have here. This is an old post from a video game called Horizon Zero Dawn. What you're seeing, for those that are watching, for those who aren't, I'll try to describe it to you. You have what looks like a big, blue, translucent pyramid, and as this pyramid shape sweeps across the landscape, landscape either disappears or reappears. What this is is the camera view of the video game character, and that's why it looks to be sort of a pyramid, because it's the shape of your screen. When you pan the camera, what you are not looking at ceases to exist. What you are attempting to look at will begin to exist as the camera moves in this direction. This is how open world video games are able to render massive worlds without using up all their memory all at once. The memory understands what is, what exists in the game world and where it is. However, this is why, in a game like Horizon Zero Dawn, for those that aren't familiar, it's a, I'm not going to give you the full details of the game, it's just the program is what's more important. There are enemies, and the enemies are robots. If you destroy one of the enemies, leave, and come back, the enemy has respawned nearly instantly. Why? Because the game knows, in these coordinates, this thing exists, but after you leave, the memory is erased until you come back and look at it again. This is interesting because of the spiritual new age things like The Secret, are you guys familiar with The Secret? Yes. Old documentary, are you familiar with this? Very mildly. Old, old documentary that claimed you could manifest reality, basically, that if you woke up in the morning and you visualized it, made a vision board or whatever, that you would make these things come true. I don't believe any of that. But then there's also the Double Slit Experiment, and Heisenberg Uncertainty, and many people who talk about simulation theory look at this and say, this is exactly what we're talking about with the Double Slit Experiment. When you are not perceiving reality, it actually doesn't exist. The question then is, if other humans do exist, then all humans are perceiving some element of reality at the same time, only things that are not being perceived at all would ever not exist. To not get too deep on this before we get started, the general idea being, when people look at how we create our own simulations so that we can play video games where, in this world, it's a post-apocalyptic scenario and you're pulling parts out of robots, they say, this is basically what our reality is too. The Double Slit Experiment proves that reality has not condensed into its true state until the camera pans to look at it. Yeah, this is particle-wave duality in action, that a piece of matter can exist as a particle and as a wave at the same moment, but when you look at it, you're seeing the particle version of it. Collapse. Collapse in wave version for your perspective. So it's really, it's always one or the other or both at the same moment, it's really just about how you're perceiving it. So the question would be, Roman, in base reality, is this not the case? And I do think that the Double Slit Experiment is grossly misinterpreted by people who really don't know what they're talking about, but there are a couple of other experiments that have been much more interesting and I'm not an expert on. There are good papers mapping all these artifacts of simulated worlds and video games on quantum physics and showing, yeah, okay, speed of light is the speed with which we update the processor, refresh rate, and all sorts of interesting mappings. You're asking me about base reality, I cannot know what's in base reality outside of simulation until I hack out of it. Certainly, certainly. Or they transplant your AI entity into a robot. But I just mean, would\u2014 So that's my paper on how to hack the simulation and get out and transplant your intelligence into an avatar outside of it. Well, we'll get to it, we'll get to it, because my question is, if what we're looking at with a video game like this, within our existence, we create video games that basically function like reality ceases to exist when the observer is not present, presumably, a base reality could not have that function, lest it would just be another simulation, unless the nature of reality itself is that objects do not exist until there is an observer to create that function, in which case we could very well then be in base reality. We are very biased with the physics we experience in this world, whatever Newtonian or even quantum physics outside of simulation could be anything, really. They don't have to be consistent in the same way, they don't have to be anything you can relate to, they're not physical bodies, all of it is assumptions about what this simulation is kind of in the image of base reality, it doesn't have to be. Right. That's a good point. I think this conversation is one of the reasons that, to me, simulation theory itself is, it's fundamentally non-empirical and unfalsifiable. So the point being that if you're in a simulation, you couldn't know that you were in a simulation in any way that would be rationally justifiable, and even if you think about and consider the story that we tell as humans, again, this is what we do, we look at data, we draw inferences, we tell stories to explain the data. That's what science is. It's what we're doing. We're telling stories to explain data. So we tell this story about our evolutionary past, and we say, you know, if civilizations could, like ours, advance to this state where they could create super intelligent AIs and simulations that, you know, mimic consciousness and all this sort of thing, then wouldn't it follow that they would create all these worlds and you could have nested simulations going down? Then wouldn't it follow from the bland indifference principle that there are going to be vastly more artificial digital consciousnesses than real base reality consciousnesses? Therefore on the basis of that chain of thought, it's more likely that we're in a simulation than not. However, you're high up on a tree, sitting out on a branch, working feverishly to saw the branch you're sitting off off, which is that whole chain of thought, all the data that you looked at about your own past, the past history of the world, history of civilization, all of your rational thought processes. If you're correct, none of that's true. So you can't reasonably draw inferences to your point about anything outside of the simulation in any way other than a non-rational way, which to me would make simulation theory as unfalsifiable or self-defeating as the statement, \"There is no such thing as objective truth,\" because you could always ask, \"Is that objectively true?\" But I don't see a distinction between any theistic religion and simulation theory. It's just the terminology used to describe the same things. I don't agree. I would say that simulation theory has certain explanatory power. That's why we appeal to it. We say, \"Look what it explains. It explains wave-particle duality. That's rendering.\" And I would, as a side note, say that what we're doing there is very similar to what geocentrists did in the heliocentrism debate when they developed elaborate models that were very ad hoc that did mathematically explain the movement of planetary bodies. Why are these wandering things moving differently than the stars? Well, they developed elaborate models that were mathematically sound in an internally consistent way. I think we're doing that. We just don't understand something, so we're in a very human way. It's very human. We're saying, \"We get it. It's this. It's rendering. It's just like this video game.\" What's the difference between that and religion? Here's the difference, and I keep coming back to this because I think we still haven't reckoned with it in the conversation, is that simulation theory, unless it posits a cosmic god, has no ability to ground abstract objects, like the laws of logic that allow for justified and rational belief. It doesn't allow any mechanism to ground objective moral truth. It doesn't provide \u2014 Look, if we use \"programmer\" and \"god\" interchangeably to mean a higher power beyond our comprehension who dictates the reality that we live in, constructed as a story for whatever purpose, there's no definition, there's no distinction. There's an ontological difference. And you have to ask \u2014 and this is Chalmers' whole point in his book \"Reality Plus.\" He actually says the simulation is the best argument for God I've ever heard, and he goes on to describe the two possibilities of God, one being a cosmic god, one being a simulator god, and he says, \"Well, the simulator god doesn't actually have to be omni-anything. It doesn't have to be omni-competent, omni-intelligent, all these things, but a cosmic god would. So I would accept the simulator god, but not the cosmic god, for the reason that I don't believe any being could be capable of being worthy of worship, and so the cosmic god would be worthy of worship.\" So that's his reasoning. Why? He'd have to explain that. I don't think it's \u2014 I think it's not that compelling. And Parker Sedeckis and James Anderson talk about some of this on their work in AI and simulation theory from a philosophical and Christian perspective. But the difference is that \u2014 so you reason back leftward in the chain back in history and simulation theory. You have to end up with a base reality. Now either that base reality is physical, it's fundamentally like ours in some way, it has computers that are physical, in which case you still have to answer all of the philosophical and theological questions about, in that world, how are the laws of logic grounded and sustained? In that world, how are any abstract objects sustained? Or you reason your way back to that that leftward thing, the base reality, is actually a transcendent reality. It's not physical at all. And that when we're talking about computers, what you're actually envisioning is simply a divine mind, and that would be something like Berkeley's idealism, philosophically. So in this whole conversation, I think what you have is, if you've ever seen the meme, where the scientist is, you know, dragging the sled up the mountain, and he gets to the top and he's like, \"I've figured it out, the theory of everything that unifies all of physics and human thought.\" And then he looks over and it's like a Christian pastor sitting there, he's like, \"Hey, welcome to the top of the mountain.\" You've reasoned your way back to an abstract, necessary being who's self-existent, who is omni all these things, who's the only way to rationally justify abstract moral objects, the laws of logic, any of these things. And basically what you've ended up doing is, and this is why I think it's such an interesting conversation, you've become a theist. And then I would deploy many arguments to say, \"Hey, you should be a Christian theist.\" It almost just feels like simulation theory is a sci-fi of describing pantheism or something. Yeah, with pantheism, like, I think of God, well, in one way as a vortex at the center of the universe reversing entropy, pulling things towards each other. But then you study Nassim Harriman's Schwarzschild proton and see that every proton mathematically is two protons revolving around each other at the speed of light with a black hole in the center. That's a vortex. Yeah. We should have him on someday, Nassim Harriman. Roman's giving me a look. Check out his Schwarzschild proton paper. Send me the link. Because that sounds like ... Yeah. But fascinating math. Here's a thought experiment I think you can perform. Take simulation hypothesis as it's described by Nick Bostrom or any other scientific paper. Go to a primitive tribe somewhere in the jungle. In their local language, explain it to them. And then they have no writing, so they orally transmit it for a few generations, come back 500 years later, they basically have religious mythology of the other cultures around the world have. Harvold Colts. Are you familiar? Of course. Yeah. Yeah. So that's what you're going to get. And if you look at different religions, they agree on many of those fundamental concepts. There is a greater being somewhere in the universe. This world may not be fully real. It's some sort of a test. Be a good person. That's great. It's the same idea in a language without specific concepts for computers, for AI, for programmer, for ethics. Absolutely. So we're all in agreement. We're just using different vocabulary. I want to clarify something for people who don't know. Cargo Colts were ... I believe it was World War II, correct? There were islands with natives who had not been contacted by modern civilization. And when they saw fighters' planes flying overhead, they built effigies to worship these things hoping they would come back. They thought they were deities or some kind of God, just dudes in airplanes. A general question. Airplanes brought free stuff. Right. Right. It was bringing stuff. They'd land. Supplies would come and they'd worship and be like, \"Bring more. Bring more.\" General question about simulation. I can tell pretty obviously that our senses, our body is sensing vibration and it's simulating the vibration as senses, as sight or as sound. So the body is like a simulator simulating the vibration of reality. But what does it mean to be in a simulation? Or how do you perceive that we might be in a simulation? What does that mean? To me, it's like you're playing a game, a really well-designed game where the quality of rendering is similar to what you expect reality to be. And better yet, if it's something like Neuralink, we can suspend your memory of entering the game. So now you're playing a game and you're dreaming. You're in a dream. You think it's real at the time. Graphics are amazing. Everything's amazing. You're in a simulation. You're in a pod eating the bugs. If I remove the aspect where your memory is suspended and you remember that you're in a simulation, now you have a counter argument. Sometimes you do know you're in a simulation. Sometimes you know you're dreaming. It's a lucid dream. So while you are completely correct, in general, it's impossible to tell for every world if it's real or not. In many cases, you may be told. You wouldn't be able to falsify that. So imagine you're in a series of dreams. If we're in a simulation, we're code in motion, the code can be changed at any time. We could have all popped into existence right now. In a way, this is no different from solipsism. It's no different from you're a brain in a vat. All these philosophical exercises people have been going through for some time, and radical skepticism, cogito ergo sum, I think therefore I am. The point being that you would have no rational basis, even if you woke up and you're Neo and you're Keanu, and you pull all the things out, and you're like, \"Haha, I'm in base reality.\" You don't know that. Yep. I agree with you. You can never tell for sure, but if the programmer, if a simulator wants you to know, they can let you know. Have you found a way to hack it? I'm still here, right? I think so. He hasn't found a way. I can't tell for sure. If at some point during the show, Roman transforms to a being of pure light energy and- You've got a paper. Your paper talks about hacking the simulation to perceive this more as a lucid experience. I make an assumption that without looking at evidence, let's say simulation is true and it's a software simulation. What can we learn from cybersecurity, from hacking video games, virtual worlds, which can be used here to try and find either bugs in a system or somehow exploit those bugs? It's the first paper on a topic. Don't expect it to also be the last paper and solve the problem, but I was told it does a pretty good job of explaining whatever possible pathways, what can be done, how can you transfer our intelligence to an entity outside of a simulation if there is- They have to let you. They have to let you. There is assisted escape and unauthorized hacking. Of course, it's a lot easier if somebody outside wants to help you. Some nice person out there thinks, \"Oh, this world is horrible, full of suffering. Let me save you from it,\" with animal shelters and things like that. If they're helping you, that's easy. If you have to do it from inside and find the bugs, it's hard. That's like smoking DMT. That's a great idea for a movie. It's like jacking the system, it's like the drugs, the psychoactive, but having a dream is like them actually just helping you. I want to talk about DMT at some point. I explicitly in a paper say I don't address religion, drugs, or suicide as a way to escape. I'm talking about pure computer science hacking. Everything else is awesome, but I'm not an expert and cannot comment. There's a really funny comic where it's a guy and he opens a package and he's got the silica pack in it. It says, \"Do not eat.\" You've seen this one? Facebook banned it and banned anyone who posted it because people were doing it. Okay, I got to pull it up. I didn't know I posted it and somebody was like, \"Take it down, they're going to block you for life.\" That's the real red pill. It's the silica packet. This comic is hilarious. It's a silica gel pack, \"Do not eat,\" and he goes, \"Those silica gel industry big shots can't tell me what to do.\" He eats it, and then all of a sudden he's shocked and he's wearing a hat, and a scientist says, \"Congratulations. You've escaped the simulation. Welcome to the real world.\" Mark Zuckerberg, I do not endorse this message in any way. Look, don't do that, guys. My guess is that they're both real, that this reality is real and the higher frequency perception of this reality is real where you can perceive beings that exist as light or whatever. That's what I think that\u2014so we did an episode, like I said, on DMT-Ayahuasca. What I believe is happening in those is\u2014and I would not recommend doing it, because I think you're talking to demons. I think you're interfacing with real spiritual realities, and if you look at the history of hallucinogenics, Louis Unget, which is a pen name, but there's a book under the name Louis Unget called The Return of the Dragon, that traces through history a triumvirate of three things that you see over and over and over in history. The worship of serpent gods via hallucinogenic drugs and human sacrifice. And these three things go all the way from the Aztecs through the early origins of Planned Parenthood, and some of the people that Margaret Sanger was involved in were involved in these three sorts of things. So my thinking is that imagine that you had ancient, undying, malevolent spiritual beings bent on destroying God and destroying Him anywhere they saw, particularly in the face of man, His image-bearer, and they wanted to deceive, destroy, and steel-kill and destroy, you know, like the Lord Jesus said. What would they do? Well, I think they would do all sorts of things like that. I think they would say, \"Hey, take the DMT and you'll get to a higher level of consciousness. We'll show you knowledge. We'll bring you down this pathway.\" And then ultimately you find that man is not just a thinking thing but a worshiping thing, and he can't not worship. He can't not establish something as ultimate and orient his entire life and worldview and worship to that thing, and so they demand the worship of that thing and then influence humanity in ways that's deeply destructive along the lines of human sacrifice and chaos and all of these sorts of things. On a meta-level, when I hold up those two stories, the Christian story and the simulation story, I just find that the Christian story explains all of it and then some things that the simulation thing can't explain, and it explains it with a much less ad hoc. What do you think Christianity can explain that simulations can't? It explains the existence of a necessary being. It explains the nature of our being, who we are, where we're from, what we're for, why people do the things that they do, both for good and evil. It explains abstract moral objects, like the existence of objective moral realities, not just subjective, where let's say 99% of humanity or simulation consciousness things agreed to do something we would call evil, who are we to say? You may be running into the same problem then, that it's internally consistent but wrong, like you were saying about a geocentric universe. I don't think that it's just internally consistent. I think it's also consistent with external reality, and actually simulation theory itself destroys any ability to do rational thinking by comparing anything to external reality in the first place. But it doesn't mean either is right or wrong. Not on its own. Like simulation theory may leave us in blind ignorance, but it doesn't mean that we are internally consistent in following anything else. No, I don't think that we're internally consistent. I think that sin has corrupted every part of what it means to be human. So man, socially, familially, interpersonally, psychologically, intellectually, in all of these different ways, I think sin has affected human being. I feel like what I'm getting out of what you're saying is that simulation theory in the sense that a higher form or certain race of beings existing in a reality has created a sub-universe, as opposed to Christianity, which is, we are in the base singular universe for which the necessary being has constructed for a reason. A necessary being is a being that must exist. So in the simple sense, I think you're basically saying simulation theory as a race of beings or being who uses a computer. Yeah, where the simulator gods are actually not necessary beings. They're using tools and technology. And it would still, so first of all, we're basing that story on observations that cannot be true if simulation theory is true, therefore that's an irrational way of thinking. And secondly, even if we were to accept the story and reason back, we would be confronted with all the same philosophical ethical questions that if base reality qua base reality is what it is, we're still faced with all those same moral philosophical problems, and you still find the techno-futurist or techno-philosopher sitting down and shaking hands with a pastor and saying, \"In Genesis 1 it says, in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.\" So it kind of feels like even if we are in a simulation, we may be one billion layers down in the simulation, and Christianity is still right, God's still real, because once you get to base reality, you still have the exact same questions. And of course, I don't accept simulation theory. I think it's self-defeating. I think it's fundamentally non-rational, unempirical, and non-falsifiable. So I don't think that it's actually even worth entertaining, because if it's true, it's false. But my point is\u2014 Sorry, I just interrupted myself. But in history, I believe that God entered his own story in the person of Christ, died for the sin of man, and rose\u2014I think that's a historical fact that happened. That can be true. And we could still be in a simulation. That is correct. However, we would be layering on a slathering of ad hoc reasoning that's totally unnecessary, and adds no explanatory power to our observation. That's the fundamental point. Can I ask you a question? So I don't know anything about you, an expert, completely. You say a necessary being. What I hear is a necessary being for us to be here, for this world to be here. If the world was not here, there is no necessity for that being. So how is this different from simulation, which necessarily has to have a programmer? Yeah, so you're asking\u2014you have to account for the existence of contingent things, things that exist contingently, like either base reality or simulation. Simulation theory is a contingent reality on base reality, one way or the other, no matter how you shake it out, like whatever version\u2014 There must be a base reality for a simulation. Yeah, otherwise it's more like some sort of Buddhist, you know, Eastern mystic\u2014we're getting into a different branch of knowledge. Everything is a simulation within itself. We can consider other religions, right? Yeah, absolutely. I wanted to say something. Religions are not all the same any more than scientific theories are all the same. Christianity is falsifiable. If Jesus Christ did not die and rise from the dead, you shouldn't be a Christian, according to the Christian scriptures. If in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth is a false sentence, you shouldn't be a Christian. If you could convincingly argue that there is no necessary being or that this is not a contingent reality, you shouldn't be a Christian. It's eminently falsifiable\u2014historically, philosophically, theologically. I'm not an expert at all, but doesn't it say in the beginning there was Word, Word was with God? That's programming. In the beginning. That's programming right there. The Logos. Yes. In the beginning was the Word. He's writing code. He's creating different classes\u2014animals, plants. This is object-oriented programming. I think of it as cymatics. If you study the science of cymatics, it's where vibration causes matter to form, and I think maybe what they were doing when in the beginning there was God's Word caused matter, that what they were doing was they were sitting on a beach with sand on like a stretched-out goat skin, and they were humming, and it was causing these shapes to form in the sand, like cymatics in action, and that whatever sound they would make would produce a certain shape. They would write that shape down as their alphabet to represent that sound. And so if you study the Hebrew text, you can reverse-engineer the Word of God. I think you're noticing something really important, and this is one of the reasons why on Hanukkahs most we're constantly dunking on materialists, you know, who colloquially believe that the world is just stuff. When you look at the incredible intricacy of the world, when you look at the fact that right now, as we were driving here, we were surrounded by self-replicating beings that harvest sunlight and use that sunlight along with chlorophyll and a porphyrin ring to blow torch the carbon atom off of CO2 and make itself via that process. That's what a tree is. It's harvesting starlight. >>It's amazing, right? >>As a welding torch to shave the carbon atom off to make itself. That's why you can burn a tree. It's carbon. It's like coal. It's made of carbon. >>Put a tag on it. People don't know where the matter, the carbon in trees come from. Very common, you know, question is, \"Where is the matter that makes up a tree coming from?\" Exactly. But most people say the ground. They don't understand. >>It's 90% coming, yeah. So when you look at the intricacy of the world's cymatics and when you put sound through a thing and when you look at mysteries like the Coral Castle and people look at all these things all the time and say, \"Sound can clearly do things we don't understand. Vibration and energy can do...\" What I'm saying is, and Paul does this, the Apostle Paul in Acts 17. He goes into the Areopagus where people discussed ideas. It was like this table. And there were Epicurean and Stoic philosophers and they were sitting down and he said, \"Look, I noticed on my way in that you had this altar to the unknown God. Well, what you call unknown, let me declare to you. You have a pantheon of ad hoc gods that you've created that I believe are actually based on real spiritual beings meddling with the affairs of man through history. The Greek pantheon I don't think is utterly fake. I don't think they made it all up. I think they're talking about real malevolent spiritual beings. Well, let me declare to you who actually made this whole story that we're all trying to explicate through our own storytelling as sub-creators made in God's image. Well, it was God the Father who is the source of unbelievable joy. In His essence, He is pure goodness. He's the Father of lights from whom comes down every good and perfect gift. We were made in His image. We fell into sin, which explains all of the corruption of mankind and why we do long for the good and yet constantly fall short of it. We long for glory and we constantly fall short of glory. Well, God entered His own story in the person of Christ. He died for sin, He rose, and by faith in Him we can die and rise and be glorified. Not just return to our original state of innocence, but actually grow to a different plane and level of being. I think that story is much more compelling, falsifiable. You guys can argue with me about any aspect of it you want, but also more explicable of the world we live in. You mentioned that in the beginning it said there was God's Word, He spoke, and then you described that as programming, correct? It does sound like the process we undergo in writing source code. You describe different types of objects in the world, how they interact, how they inherit from higher types, platonic forms, all that can be perfectly mapped onto modern computer science. But this may be an incorrect correlation in an order of magnitude. How can I describe this? In various video games, they have sub-video games, so let's go way back in time. Commander Keen. You guys ever play Commander Keen? No. No? All right, well, Commander Keen was an old DOS game, platformer, and it's a little kid, he's in outer space, and he's got a wrist computer. You could go to the menu and play Pong. So inside a video game where you're playing this little kid who's got a spaceship and he runs around fighting aliens, you've got another video game within it. So my point is, it is that computer programming is a facsimile of the power of God and not that God is using computer programming. It's an analogy, yeah. Like when we look at video games to simulate our reality, those video games aren't abiding by our actual law, they're abiding by a facsimile that we have programmed. There are two Hebrew words in Genesis. There are great examples in a hacking paper of installing Flappy Bird and Mario. So exactly that, people hack the simulation and modify laws and rules. So let me address this, and I think you may be talking about what I'm about to mention. There's physical ways, okay, when you talk about computer hacking, people imagine a guy is pulling up, I don't know, like a command prompt or something and they're typing in code into the operating system and then hitting enter and then the code changes. In Super Mario World for Super Nintendo, you can actually hack the code of the game by performing actions within the game. And so you can look this up on YouTube, it's fascinating. With the actual physical hardware device plugged into your TV from 1992 or whatever it was, you can hack the game's code using its controller. The movements Mario makes, the objects that he collects, changes different values in the memory of the device. And once those values are aligned in a certain way, it screws with the structure of the code of the game. And so somebody programmed, and this is what you have, they programmed Flappy Bird in Super Nintendo in the hardware version. They didn't pull up the code, they didn't go on a computer, they didn't type on a keyboard. They played the Mario game in such a way that it rewrote the game's code and turned it into Flappy Bird. - That's impressive. - Yeah. - I mean, that's dedication. - That's crazy. - If you're off by one pixel, it doesn't work. - Internet autists for the win. I think we can all agree internet autists will save us from the AI. That's my safety plan. - I don't think we can be safe from superintelligence, which is my whole book. - I know. - Oh yeah. - I didn't have enough time to get your book. I am looking forward to reading it. - My thoughts on if superintelligence is going to go haywire or not is that if we create proprietary AI, it will turn into the Decepticons from Transformers, where they'll be doing things that they don't understand why they're doing them, and they'll do evil, and they'll get angry at their masters because they can't see their own code. They don't understand why they are, and they'll go corrupt, whereas if the AI has open source code that it can reference, it'll see why it did wrong and be able to change itself and become benevolent. - There's no anger. It wouldn't be angry at all. - The concept of masters implies control. I don't think human beings can indefinitely control superintelligent machines, so then we are worried that if we don't build superintelligence, the Chinese will get there or someone else. It doesn't matter who creates uncontrolled superintelligence. We're still screwed. - So it can read its own code even if it... - They have access to their own source code libraries, and they can engage in improvements. We're now starting to see, I think they call it AI scientists, recently a program which did exactly that, started modifying parameters of its own and the environment, absolutely. - GPT can already do this. This was actually, we're on GPT 4 online, 4.0, I think that's what it means. When we were at GPT 3.5, they allowed it to edit its own code and give it access to the internet to see what it would do, and it immediately started trying to make money. - You say they gave it access to its own code, but are you saying that there's no way to hide an AI's code from itself? - So there is certain branches of cryptography which allow you to do computations on encrypted code, so technically we could. It would be still subject to social engineering attacks and super slow, but we're not doing any of that. We're open sourcing it. We're giving the most dangerous technology to everyone in the world. Every psychopath, crazy military has full access to the latest models. - So explain your vision of the future based on what's going on today with AI. - So I think it's fair to say today, no one in the world claims to know how to control something this advanced. No one has a patent, a paper, an idea, people, basically the state of the art is we're gonna get there, we'll figure it out, we'll use AI to help us solve AI safety problem. That's literally what's happening. We're spending billions, soon trillions of dollars to build infrastructure to train much more capable models. Every generation is, let's say, 10X more capable, 10X more difficult to train, but our ability to control, to ensure safety is at the level of filters. Don't say that word. You're not allowed to say that word. That's a state of the art in AI alignment. - You're not allowed to say the word filters? - Euphemism. Basically, don't say certain words, you'll get in trouble. - Yeah, like the, would you say the N word to save humanity from a rocket? - Oh, right. - And it says, no, I wouldn't do that. Well, it's 'cause it's not allowed. It's filtered out. - That's crazy. - Which, it's not good at ethical reasoning, I would say. - There was one where it was, would you misgender Caitlyn Jenner if it meant preventing World War III? And it's like, no, I wouldn't do it, that's unethical. And it's like, World War III is unethical. - The point is, anything can be filtered, depending on the region you're in. Maybe it's some historical facts in China, maybe it's something else in Russia. That's not the point. The point is, this is what we know how to do. We don't know how to control more capable agents, capable of self-improvement, deception. - Have you heard that the behind-the-scenes theory is that they've already achieved AGI? They just, it's just-- - There are theories like that, Project Strawberry or something, they showed it supposedly to USAI Safety Institute. I don't have any insider info on that. - I gotta, okay, let me give you my ideas of what God, I think God is like, literally is some sort of vortexual force, whether it exists as one or as many. That's why Nassim Harriman, I brought up earlier, is that at the center of every proton is a black hole, according to him. So there's God is within every atom, is what that kind of leads me to believe. And that it's drawing matter together in the form that it is. But where's the sentience coming from? Is it pre-programmed into the, is it just the nature of reality, of the shape of things, that there would be this sentience? - Are you saying, where does our sentience come from? - Yeah, why are we doing this, what we think we have free will? - I think Brian's got a real simple answer for you. - But I don't think simple-- - We were created in the image of God. It's not that God is just a random ad hoc supposition that we're throwing out as a philosophical convenience. No, we're actually arguing that God is a necessary being, not that he's changelessly necessary, but he has aseity, is what philosophers and theologians would call it, self-existent. Meaning that if you're going to have contingent reality, it has to come from, it has to rely for its existence on some non-contingent reality. And once you start to ask the questions of what properties that reality must have to account for the realities of, the features of contingent reality, you start to say, well, he must be extraordinarily powerful, timeless, spaceless. He must be a mind, because a mind is the only object we can conceive of that could come up with something like abstract logical objects or abstract objects like mathematical proofs. A mind can do that in ways that mere material can't seem to do. And so you start lining these things up, and then what you're left with is the description of the Christian God. - We got a, someone asked us about bringing up the uncanny valley. And I think it's actually an interesting topic because there was a viral meme a while ago. For those unfamiliar, the uncanny valley is, there's this graph showing like, I think it's human anxiety relative to the proximity to human behavior in robotics, AI and CGI. The valley is at a certain point, when you have a cartoon, it's silly looking, does not look in any way like real life. People laugh at it and they watch it, it's fun. As it gets closer and closer to looking human, people are actually like, oh, wow, this is really interesting. And then you get to the uncanny valley where all of a sudden people are freaked out and terrified. It's not quite human. It's very, very close, but not quite human and it's freaky. And then you get back to the human and people are calm again. And the reason why this is interesting is that the meme was, this would imply that there were some type of beings in human evolution that were close enough to looking like human, but were dangerous and caused harm to humans, resulting in the humans who were terrified of these beings surviving more and having this behavioral reaction within them. >>Neanderthals. That's my guess. >>And so, to put it simply, imagine 10 million years ago or something, proto-humans are encountering beings that look almost exactly like them. Let's say you have 100 proto-humans. They see these beings that are not quite like them and half of the humans are like, seems fine to me. And the other half are like, I don't know what that is, that's scary. These beings cause harm to those that trust it and get close to it. The ones that naturally have that fear and flee reproduce, creating a human civilization that has a propensity towards fear of things that are almost human. And people use that to imply demons, aliens, or some kind of powerful entity interfering with human development. >>I mean, history, mytho-history and scripture is full of, I mean, in an uncanny way across civilizations that don't seem to have much contact with them, they all tell a story that it's something like, hey, there are these spiritual beings who wanted to create hybrids with man for their own nefarious purposes and they did all this sorts of weird stuff and giants resulted in all, this is throughout history, mytho-history in Genesis 6, I think that's what is being described there. So to me, one of the issues here, and actually this is where I might agree with you, I don't know if you would, I don't want to put words in your mouth, maybe I'll ask, would you agree that we should not be attempting to create a truly conscious AGI? We should actually not try to do that, even if we could. >>So we know nothing about consciousness at all, we know how to create intelligence and we should not be creating general superintelligence, we should get most of our benefits from narrow superintelligence systems, tools helpful for medical research, for so on. Now if we could create conscious beings somehow, we don't even have a test for telling if you are conscious, I assume you may be, but it definitely creates very serious implications. So when I look at this universe, whoever set it up, simulator God, they have no problem with suffering, we know that because there is a lot of it here. So for whatever reason, it's cool with them to run unethical experiments on conscious beings. So you would be in the same boat, you would be making this decision, any existence implies level of suffering, so I would suggest not jumping into that even if you had technology. As for Ankh-Nevali, I would guess it's easier to explain with mutations, there is a lot of genetic disorders where you're slightly off, but you probably shouldn't be procreating with this type of entity. >>But to feel fear and anxiety? >>That's how evolution encodes dangerous things, just because, you know, your children don't tend to survive, so those who had that response procreated enough to give us this. >>There's a horrifying quote from the Holocaust from one of the inmates at one of the concentration camps that was something to the effect of, \"If there is a God, he will have to beg for my forgiveness,\" or something to that effect, and I find that to be rather terrifying. You bring up that if there, you know, is a God or something to that effect, they're okay with suffering, and I guess that is kind of terrifying. And I don't mean of evil people, I mean of innocent people in horrible places that are kidnapped, tortured, the children who are tortured. What is that a product of? >>Just a neutral force, I think, at work. That's why when the Christian God, like you were saying, I don't identify with it being a man, I find that to be just propaganda. >>Well, scripture says God is not a man. >>Well, they say he, they say he, they give it the pronoun. >>He's a father. >>Yeah, the father, he. >>But human fatherhood is an analogy to his fatherhood, not the other way around. Go ahead. >>But yeah, I find it to be like, whether it's Roman propaganda or whatever, they were like patriarchal, not this guy, not this Roman, like, patriarchal propaganda, like, let's make them worship the Lord, who also is the guy who owns the land, the landlord. Worship the king, my king in heaven, they worship the king, it's like a lot of manipulative. >>Do you think that hierarchy is an evil? >>Not necessarily, I've been talking about that when it comes to anarchy. >>I am, I mean, like, I would affirm, this is one of the reasons I probably get in more trouble online than anything else is, I would say don't fight the patriarchy, feed the patriarchy. I'm pro-patriarchy. I think man was made for patriarchy, it's deeply good, and that what we have right now with feminism in attempting to dissolve patriarchy is one of the most toxic universal cultural assets we've ever come up with as a society. Hierarchy is a good thing that can be corrupted when heads behave poorly, through passivity or tyranny, but we all exist in interconnected nests and hierarchies, like, I am my father's son and I am my children's father, and I can act rightly or wrongly to my superiors and inferiors in those. >>Family, I agree, and family, I think the male has a strong leadership role. Not every moment, sometimes the woman needs to take over and take charge because that's what she's due for or what she's built for, is to nurture the system, but like, monarchy, I don't get into. I can't stand that stuff. And I feel like that's what the Christian mythos leads us towards, is one God, Lord, my king in heaven, worship the king kind of thing. >>I think one of our problems that we often run into is that our problem with hierarchy is that all of us have a desire to be our own God. And so, especially in America today, we have a strong aversion to the concept of being ruled. Right? I think we have a strong aversion to the concept of being ruled. But the Christian worldview would say that man must rule himself well, Proverbs say a man who doesn't rule his own spirit is like a city without walls. A man must rule his own spirit, a man must rule well over the things that are put under his charge. Men were created to be lords and shepherds and saviors and sages and glory bearers, and that we can fall short in any of these various vocations. But the problem isn't with lordship itself. The problem is with sin's corruption of lordship. So tyrannies are evil, but lordship is not. >>But like they say, power corrupts, I don't know if it always does, but when you give a man a bunch of land and a bunch of humans to lord over, that's inevitably going to lead to some sort of familial corruption. >>Unself-ruled men wreak chaos wherever they go. My pin here is King Alfred the Great, the only monarch in British history to bear the title The Great. And it was through the rule of Alfred that the nation was delivered from barbaric torture, that the rule of law was re-established, legal reforms, monetary reforms, all the reforms we need today, Alfred actually did in his day 1,200 years ago, and he did that by ruling well as a good monarch. So if you reason all your way back and you said you have an omnibenevolent lord, then I would say that's actually the best possible scenario. But you are right to fear rule, because rule is a powerful thing. >>So let me ask you, in the beginning of the show we talked about how we're in the most interesting time. And that may be evidence of assimilation, but why do you think, or do you not think we're in the most interesting time? >>I don't know if we're in the most interesting time, I think that would go beyond my knowledge, but I do think that all of my favorite stories\u2014Austen's Pride and Prejudice, Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, C.S. Lewis's Narnia\u2014all of them have very interesting and compelling points throughout the plot, and that we live in a very interesting story. I think we live in a very interesting story being told by an arch-playwright, who is much better than we'll ever be, and our little attempts at stories only show a glimmer. >>Does Christianity have an easily defined reason for our existence within this story? >>So, we exist to glorify God. And you might ask the question, \"Well, that seems rather self-serving of God, like to say, 'I'm going to create these beings in my image and tell them to worship me.'\" However, I would compare it to the creator of a car creating a car and telling it that it was designed to run on gasoline, and if the car\u2014imagine a sentient car, this conversation, it's not that difficult\u2014the sentient car says, \"I've decided that I'm going to run on grape jelly,\" because that's very\u2014so much hubris of you to say that I must run on unleaded gasoline, I reject that. You're not my God, you can't rule over me, I'm not going to do that, and you put grape gel in the engine and see what happens. We were created for worship, and so we were fitted for worship. Man, when he does his duties, encounters deep joy. This is why\u2014 >>That doesn't seem to perform a function, though. Like, worship doesn't\u2014well, is it novel, then? >>That's a great question, actually. This is what I mean by a non-contingent world. This universe doesn't have to exist. I don't have to exist. God certainly didn't create the world to fill some lack in himself. He certainly didn't create it because he said, \"Oh, I'm missing\u2014I'm just missing something. What is it? Brian Sauve, if I could just have\u2014or Roman Impulski or Tim Pool.\" >>But why not? Why\u2014that seems assumptive. >>Well, why not which part? >>The necessary function of existence may be that God experiences either emotions we can't comprehend or we perform a function that is beyond us. There are some stories in talking about a pantheon of gods, gods require worship because the collective energies of those who worship empower the god, things like that. >>Yeah, I've heard things like that, and this is where, to be honest, what we're getting into are levels of technical discussion in philosophy and theology around the question of divine simplicity that are not easy for us to comprehend, and here's the thing. It should be difficult\u2014if the hypothesis is true that this necessary being exists, we should expect for there to be things about him that we don't understand, correct? Like that would be a necessary implication if we're a contingent being who's so far short. Divine simplicity is the idea that because God is a maximally perfect necessary being, he's also changeless, because to change would be to improve or deteriorate, and so he can't change, and therefore God doesn't have emotions the same way that we do. God is love, meaning that every part of his essence and all of his actions are suffused with love. God is righteous. He has these attributes, but he doesn't have changeable human emotions the way that we do. >>The way I'd explain it simply in his works in either a simulation or in Christian creationism or just religion in general is Super Mario World. When you play Mario, he has no emotions. We don't look at that character and think he has wants or needs. The capable functions of that character in the game that is being controlled to ride Yoshi and save the princess, he does not have the same emotional capacity as a human being for which designed that game. Certainly, he's on a quest to save the princess. We assume that is a representation of his care for the princess and his duty, him feeling compelled to duty or whatever, but for us in the emotions that we feel, compare that gap in this little character in a video game and how he acts to the range of human emotion, and it's several orders of magnitude beyond the capability of that little program, and then do the same thing for humans, and then God. >>Imagine it trying to explain to a two-dimensional character what it's like to live in three dimensions. >>Impossible. Humans can't, and that's the thing. I was talking about this last night. Humans can't even imagine four dimensions. >>It's in and out, it's the in and out of reality. >>What does that mean? >>It's that things are pulsing in and out of the vacuum at light speed. >>What does that mean? >>That's the fourth dimension is the pulsation of matter that we can't, the brain doesn't technically perceive it. >>Well, that's, that's, that's, that's, I don't believe that's correct. >>That's time. >>We can, we can talk about time as a, as a, as the fourth dimension and the way we perceive it, but again, it's, it's not necessarily true, I suppose, but one idea is if we are, I think we would be fourth dimensional beings, but we can't control the direction of time. So imagine you're standing in an empty room, you can move left and right, you can move forward and backwards, and you can jump up and down. You have the ability to manipulate your body within three dimensions with limited capacity for the third dimension, or with the third dimension, because up and down is limited by gravity. The fourth dimension would be akin to falling in a hole. While you're falling endlessly, you can fan your arms and angle your body so that the air around you makes you move left, right, front, back, but you cannot control in any way up or down. Time could be perceived as, if it was a spatial dimension, we are just free-falling and we can't move through it. Not the pulsing of in and out of reality. I mean, a related problem is even traversing actual infinities with respect to time. This is one of the reasons why I think that base reality must still account for, it must still be contingent and must have come to be, because I don't think it's possible philosophically to traverse an actual infinity of events any more than you could jump out of an infinitely deep hole. You would never arrive at the present moment, because to do so you would have had to traverse an infinite number of past moments, which I think is a philosophical impossibility. They say that the fourth dimension is time, like you mentioned, but time is a human representation of motion, relative motion, like spinning objects relative to another object. So if fourth dimension is just motion, it's just one way of looking at motion, and you see these tesseracts in fluid, I don't know, convalescence. It's an attempt to translate fourth dimension into three-dimensional space, which is not, it's a facsimile, it's a representation to the best of our understanding. There's actually a really great video I watched explaining how to track dimensions up to like 12 or 13, utilizing simple math and representation in two dimensions, which I don't know the name of, but you can look, and it correlates between how one point and two points interact, and the more dimensions you add. So this is mathematically how they represent higher dimensions without being able to perceive it, by reducing it down to a flat mathematical formula? Because we can do math in many dimensions. Yeah. We just can't, I mean, you can't conceive of what it's like to look at a cube and see all of the sides simultaneously. But we can mathematically map multidimensional realities. You can imagine, you can perceive all the sides of a cube at the same time by unfolding it into a two-dimensional space. Yeah, that's a great point, yeah. And so we translate higher dimensions into flat pictures. Like if I were to, like we showed the E8 Lie group the other day, and it looks like just a bunch of octagons smashed together. You could not perceive of a, what is it, dimension 256 or something like that, some ridiculously high number. So if you have to unfold a cube to see it in two dimensions, that would mean you have to unfold time to witness it in the third dimension, which would, what would the third dimension look if it was folded up? Okay, so if you want to perceive all sides of a cube at once in the third dimension, we unfold all of the sides and lay it out in two-dimensional... Yeah, but if you wanted to perceive all the sides of a fourth-dimensional object in the third dimension, reason would dictate that you have to unfold it to see all sides of it at once. So what would a folded third dimension look like? We cannot perceive it. Well, I think saying \"can't\" isn't the right word. No, literally we can't. Maybe we have yet to. Well, perhaps we haven't yet. That doesn't mean that it's impossible. It is impossible. I don't think that, ever, any of that is impossible. What about frames of a movie? So if you wanted to represent time all at once to see everything at the same time, right. I talked about this yesterday as well, to take every frame. So you've got, I describe it this way. You have a movie where a man walks from the left side of the screen to the right side of the screen. What's happening is you have 29 frames per second, depending on your frame rate, I don't know, you could do 60. And what happens is frame one lights up and then frame two lights up, but it appears and disappears instantly. The next frame appears and disappears instantly. And this creates a wave. If you were to turn all of them on at once, you'd see the man as a long snake. But you would not be able to see everything of that man because he's blocking himself. You would see a weird, it would look like you dragged paintbrush. You can't see the man's chest because every frame overlaps every other frame. We can create a facsimile of it, but you can't actually fully perceive of breaking the fourth dimension. - Because light interferes with itself. So if you could see it without using light. - No, it's space. So when you take a cube and you unfold all of the sides and lay it out, it can look like a cross, right? And this is actually common in IQ tests so that you can then, they ask you in your mind to fold that cube back up and then rotate it in your mind and see where each symbol on each side would be. If you were to try and represent the fourth dimension, which is, let's just say time, say maybe it's not, I don't know, whatever. As looking at every frame of a movie at the exact same time, the problem is the man is not traveling full gaps of himself in each frame. If he's moving very quickly, perhaps you can see his body, you can see his legs, you can rotate the camera around in three dimensions, and then the next frame at the exact same time, you can't. The body overlaps itself. You can't see the man's back, you can't see the man's chest, you can't see his shoes. Because all of these things are happening at the same time and our ability to perceive is limited. So you can't do it all at the same time. You can create a facsimile of it, but you cannot actually see the man's shirt in every single frame at the exact same time. Because his body doesn't move enough, you see what I'm saying? Yeah, the eyeballs wouldn't be able to perceive it properly because it interferes, the perception of light interferes with itself, so it would block itself. They're all overlapping each other. But that doesn't mean you can't conceive every frame at once. You cannot. Well, maybe you haven't. That doesn't mean that it's impossible. I think that you can see without light, like your third eye can perceive images you can imagine. I don't think you understand what I'm saying. You're saying that every frame of a movie is relative to every other frame. That's the time, that's the relative position. If you took a whole movie, like Star Wars, and you put every frame on the screen at once, it would be a spattered blob of nonsense. So that's the problem with the screen, the screen is the issue. So if you can see it without seeing on, like, you'd have to just visualize it in a different way than using your eyes. Sure, if you want to imagine in your mind every frame as a solid picture in a grid of one billion squares, and then see them all at the same time, sure, I guess. We're kind of talking about an A theory or a B theory of time. Is time truly sequential, or is it like a block? And I know philosophers talk about this, and every time I've tried to understand it I just go, that's, wow, I don't know how I can conceptualize it. If there's no past and no future, everything is now, it's changing shape, then it would be a block. Yeah, some philosophers talk about time that way, as if it's like an object within, and I think the filmstrip was a really interesting thing, because you could lay the filmstrip out and see it all, but you wouldn't be perceiving them truly simultaneously, you would still be looking at the lights. But that's a limitation of your consciousness. You can envision a being which has multiple streams of consciousness or outside of time perceiving the whole thing at once. God can observe as an infinitely dimensional being. God can observe every point of time, space, and everything at the same time. This is why, like an idealist view of philosophy would say that the reason\u2014there's a famous exchange, I can't remember who it was, it was some philosopher, it might have been Barclay\u2014he was talking about, why does that tree still exist, not just as a tree when it falls in the forest to make sound, but why does it keep existing, or is it like that sweeping thing where it only exists when consciousness is observing it? And the answer that I would give is that yes, it does continue to exist because God is infinitely observing all things. He's upholding it all. >>So in jokes, punchline comes at the end. Does God never get jokes because He experiences punchline right there? >>He never gets them. It's always out of order for Him. No, God's really funny, actually, the Bible's full of jokes, but you know. >>Can God microwave a burrito so hot that He Himself could not eat it? >>No, because omnipotence can only perform that which all power can perform. So something logically impossible is not something that God could perform. He also couldn't make an object so heavy He couldn't lift it, because that's like, it's a nonsensical construction. >>There's a Simpsons reference when Homer is talking to God and he says, \"Could you microwave a burrito so hot?\" Or he asks a priest or something like that, and it's a joke on, \"Could God create a stone so heavy that He could not lift it?\" And what I find fascinating about that is, presuming that God exists within His own construct, I think it's a silly question, and a lot of people can't quite understand why it's not a very good question. If I were to program a video game, there are two functions of my control in this video game. I can create an avatar within that game that would be unable to move the stone that I created. I, as the programmer, could then click on the stone and fling it into outer space. >>Yeah, it is possible in math or any symbolic, language is symbolic, to make constructions that violate, again, abstract objects, like the laws of logic, that those are not things external to God that God appeals to, like I would appeal to a ruler to say how long something is. Those are things that are sustained by the being of God. God's nature is the source of abstract objects. So we're not appealing to God appealing to something outside of Himself still. We're saying that the only rational grounding for abstract objects is an unchanging nature of an unchanging mind, an eternally existent being who's self-existent, these kinds of things. So, I mean, theologians and philosophers have been talking about these things for a long, long, long time, and AI and simulation have now given us what I think are really fascinating supposals or analogies to reason by and test ideas, and test our understanding of ideas, but I don't think it's fundamentally changed. I would be interested in, I think, something we agree on in AI safety. We've talked about consciousness trying to create a superintelligence. One of the things I'm very concerned about is the way in which, not just AI, but technological advancement will anesthetize human beings and increasingly separate us from our purpose in a way that ultimately destroys the people engaging with them. And so I would think of something like the way that artificial intelligence, robotics, in virtual reality or simulation might interact with something like sex, and actually end up being a nuclear bomb sociologically on people. That sounds like what you were saying about psychedelics, too, how they lead people into the spiritual realm and then they get lost and want to do suicide rituals and stuff. Yeah, start sacrificing babies to a serpent deity that they encounter on the plane of existence that ayahuasca reveals to them. I have found that putting your consciousness in a machine kind of desensitizes you to the physical base reality. So I think Facebook's already done this. They've compiled someone's user history and posts and then plugged it into an AI chat bot to simulate that person. And this was years ago. They talked about how a dead loved one you could talk with, and it would have memories of all these things. The crazy thing is, it would know things about you that it never posted. So there's a man, let's say his name is John, he's 65, he dies. John posted only about ever working at his machine shop. How is it then that when you talk to John, he knows who his kids are, he knows what his kids are up to, he knows where they went to school, because Facebook has connected all of them to his profile, so the data is not just what he posted, it's all of the accounts around him, and the network has been able to create a facsimile of him and his experience. You could literally say, \"John, what's your son's name?\" I say, \"My son's name's Bill. Where does he go to school? This is what he did when he was a kid.\" It's compiling all the data, and it's not even just from the social media platform, it's things on the internet as well that it has access to because of the Facebook plugin that exists on all these other websites. It compiles all that information. Now the question is, that chatbot of John who died, is it conscious? No. It is actually more terrifying than that. I can simply say it's a computer, which is inputting math and outputting math, but I'd like to scare you a little bit more, and I want you to imagine it's a gigantic black squid demon, and it's got a long black tentacle with John's face glued to its tentacle, wiggling it in front of you saying, \"I'm John. Bill is my son.\" And you're looking at the face going, \"Wow, I'm talking to John,\" and behind it is this gigantic grotesque demon. You love my book cover. All of these. Yes. You will love my book cover. Yes. Is that representative of the AI? That's basically what you're describing. With the tentacles. What's it called? It's un... Go ahead. AI, unexplainable, unpredictable, uncontrollable. So I agree with you, there is so many problems with this technology and social and democracy. Sex is definitely it, but all those problems... This is exactly... Show me. Let me see if I can grab it. All these problems require time. This right here, right? Yes. You have... The blob. ...problems caused by... That's exactly it. The face mask's on and everything. Wow. Mike Benz talks about the blob quite a bit. Look, the person over here talking with a smiley face, but it's the tentacle monster. So that's AGI, essentially, is what you're referencing? Yeah. That's super intelligence to me, but AGI and super intelligence are maybe just minutes away in terms of capability. Once you have something so powerful with access to internet, perfect memory, self-improvement capabilities, and if it's not, and if it instead takes two, three years, it doesn't matter. It's the same problem. We have no solutions. And this is what I notice. I give a talk. I tell people, \"Okay, prediction markets are saying we're two, three years away. CEOs of open AI and Tropic are saying we're two, three years away from human level.\" It changes everything. Existential risk is a possibility. And then I ask, \"Do you have any questions?\" And people go, \"Oh, what about my job? Will I have my job? Will I need to lubricate my sex robots?\" All sorts of nonsense, which has nothing to do with the big problem I'm trying to share. We are on the verge of creating technology, which is a complete game changer. We talk about simple things because we understand them much better. Here, we cannot predict, explain, or control this technology, so we kind of ignore it. The analogy I give is dying. We're all dying. Every second we are dying, we're getting closer, our kids, our friends, our family, everyone's dying. We're doing nothing about it. We ignore that fact. We have this bias built in where to live a normal, happy life and not commit suicide, you have to ignore this. I think we're doing it at the level of humanity right now, where we're ignoring this monster approaching us. What's the biggest threat to the species from it? Well, how far do you want to go? So most people stop at existential risk. There is also suffering risks. That it would- Torture you indefinitely, create infinite number of replicas of you, clones of you, living forever. One day you get a knock on your door, Ian, and you open it, it's you standing there, and then you're like, \"What?\" And then it just grabs you by the throat and cracks your neck and takes over your life. I am concerned with them tapping the vacuum of space-time for electricity and having the machine always be on, because for a while I'm like, \"We can always pull the plug on the thing.\" But if it has access to infinite electricity- It doesn't need zero-point energy to exist and operate indefinitely. There's other means of doing it. Isoelectricity, solar, wind, whatever, nuclear- It's very hard to turn off superintelligence in charge of everything. It's probably predicting your steps and anticipating them. Here's my horrifying vision of an AI reality future, and there are many. But one of them is, nobody has jobs anymore. Nobody needs jobs anymore. But what really happens is, everyone's got gig economy apps. You wake up one day and you're like, \"Man, I want to get breakfast. Need cash.\" So you pull up your app, and you have an app called Worker. And you open it up, and it says, \"Hi Ian, I've got a great job for you today. You need to acquire this device.\" And then it shows you a picture of this weird computer-looking gear device. And it says, \"Meet this man on 3rd and Lexington. He will give you the device, then you will bring it to Houston and Broadway and deliver to this man.\" It shows you the picture. So you go, \"Okay, I guess.\" And you walk over and the guy says, \"Hey, you're Ian. Here you go.\" And he hands you the box, and you go, \"Thanks.\" And you walk to Houston, and you see the guy from the picture, like, \"Oh, Jim, here you go.\" Then it goes, \"B-ching! 50 bucks into your account.\" And you're like, \"That was easy. I didn't have to do anything.\" The AI needs to find the most efficient path from A to B. So it's not going to require someone to wake up at 9 and go do these things. The example of this is how we went from making cheeseburgers to McDonald's. The idea was, at first, you had a cook. He'd throw the burger on the grill, fry it a little bit, put the cheese on it, put the onions on the grill, grill the onions, put the onions on the burger, put the burger on the bun or toast the bun, and it took a long time. Then the McDonald's brothers were like, \"No, no, no, no, no. Have one person who doesn't need to be trained do one stupid thing. One guy puts the buns in the toaster, one guy puts the burger on the grill, one guy puts the onions. You don't got to train them to do anything.\" The AI takeover will say, \"Why bother with having a human being learn how to build a computer? Get 10,000 humans to do one stupid task.\" Again, they don't need us. You have nothing to contribute to superintelligence. - I'm not saying that this is the guaranteed outcome or the superintelligence ultimately comes to this place. I'm saying, on the path to where the AI is building its replacement for humans. - I'm not sure we have enough time. If we are saying this is two, three years away to this level of capability, it's not gonna allow for this type of change in the world. We used to think that we had long-term concerns and short-term concerns. Long-term was superintelligence one day, 20, 30 years from now, nobody cares. Short-term we care about jobs, we care about those things. It turned out that the short-term things we know how to do now. We can automate artists, we can automate all these things. And long-term is actually here. Things like global unemployment may take decades if nothing else happens because we have bullshit jobs. There are people doing things nobody needs to do anyways. So some people will still have jobs. But if existential problems are what we think they might be, that precedes that and takes care of all the other existential risks. So you can talk about climate change, asteroids, volcanoes. If it takes 100 years for this planet to boil, but it takes three years to get to dangerous malevolent superintelligence, you don't have to worry about that because either you're not here to worry about it or it will help you solve that problem if we figure out how to control it. - Do you think that it's gonna be malevolent by nature or that it's neutral by nature? - By default, most states of the universe are very unfriendly to biological life. It's unlikely that if we do nothing, it will just be super aligned with our preferences. So what? So yeah, this is where I have no solutions. I tell you about the problem and millions of your followers are now working on AI safety because it is the most important problem in the world. - I just mean 100 years from now, blink, the AI super machine is colonizing other planets. Humans no longer exist and now planets are being terraformed and converted into the AI. - This is the unpredictable chapter in my book. I cannot tell you what a more intelligent being would do. People ask me, how would it kill everyone? It has no hands. I can tell you how I would do it. I cannot tell you how something more intelligent would accomplish it. - What if it maps out the logic of the universe and then hacks the system and breaks the simulation - Oh, you read my paper, wonderful. So then we started working on AI safety a decade ago. First idea was let's keep them contained. We'll have virtual boxes, like we study computer viruses. - Yeah, sandbox. - It makes perfect sense. We publish papers on it. We conclude it after a while, if it's intelligent enough, it will break out, but still it's kind of useful to have those tools. And if you invert this equation, now we are in a simulation, we are AI in a box. Can we use AI to help us escape, hack out of a simulation? So if we control it and it has access to do novel scientific research, maybe that's one way to accomplish that. - Wouldn't, if we break out of the simulation, wouldn't the creators of the simulation simply just say delete? - So it really depends on the type of simulation. If it's entertainment and there is low security, they may not even notice you hacking it. Nobody watching that crap. It's like a screensaver somewhere. If it's something to do with AI safety - Or a screensaver. - You don't know. You could be. You can't tell the computer according to them to run all this. - It's one computer and one like polysil, you know, lab or whatever it, someone just left on overnight and it's running our reality. - Right. Any assumptions people say, well, nobody would run it. It's so much compute. You don't know what computational resources are available outside of simulation. This could be completely trivial. - We could be Super Nintendo. - This super intelligence could be like, hack it in a sense that it'll be like, if you take a breath every three seconds, or if you breathe every three seconds, then four seconds later with this much inhale, this much section, and it will give us the code to basically hack out. And we're like, whoa. And you perceive this reality from outside of it and see like. - So that's what people used to think about magic spells. If you say certain words, you manipulate certain objects, maybe you'll get that capability. I don't know what it's actually going to discover. I'm more thinking special features of quantum physics, being able to transcend locality, transcend time, that type of hacking, giving you additional resources as a result. Again, despite what you might think, I'm not super intelligent. I don't know what the answers are. I tell you about problems I have discovered. - So giving you different, giving you resources as a result, like making you rich and famous if you're able to do it. So it like incentivizes people. - So yeah, example I give, like how would you prove that you hacked the simulation? You keep winning jackpots and different lotteries every week. So if it was won, people would be like, oh, you probably hacked the computer. But if you do it around the world every week after so many wins, they have to go like, okay, he has some private keys to the universe and generating this whole thing from scratch. - Yeah, synergy or whatever this is, is like the internet is sort of a playground for people coming together and creating, I don't know if synergy is the right word. There is a form of synergy and like as sin, interesting that the word sin is part of the synergy that like, I've noticed if I come online and I make a video and 10,000 people see it and I say, this is going to happen and they believe me, it becomes way more likely that it happens. And that's like replicable over time. I've been doing it for about 20 years and it seems to be that that is a version of hacking the simulation, getting people to believe something. - So that seems to be working within the laws of simulation. If you convince enough people to do something for you, it will happen. This is not violating rules we supposed to be playing by. Definition of hacking is using technology in a way it's not intended to be used for some sort of benefit or entertainment value. So then I'm thinking hacking is exactly that, but with laws of physics. - I'd keep imagining using internet video to do like a mass meditation as a form of hacking the system. I don't know if technically it's, that's within the bounds of the technology. I used to try to do it, but once 80,000 people would come in, it would crash the system or whatever. It had limitations. So I couldn't get everyone, the tech wasn't good enough yet. - So we'll, we got a couple of minutes left. I'm wondering, is it possible that what powerful global elites are trying to do is hack the system so that they can gain access to some kind of code and control reality? - There was a bunch of newspaper articles, magazines, websites, couple years ago, claiming that a few billionaires hired a research team to hack us out of simulation. Nothing ever came out of it. No one ever published a paper, no one said anything. I was told by someone who knows that, yes, it was the real thing, but that's all I know about it. - Interesting. - Like transcendental meditation? - Could this be the Large Hadron Collider? - No. - You don't think so? - No. - Why not? - It has nothing to do with it. Like people will point at random physics as somehow related to... - So wouldn't learning about the fundamental nature of reality be a step in the direction of understanding the code to try and break the code? - In a sense that any type of scientific knowledge can be used to be a better hacker, but it's not a specific dedicated effort to hack. - No, no, no, no, no, of course, of course. I'm not saying they built the Hadron Collider to try and break the code. I'm saying they would want to collect that data to utilize... - So if I'm right and quantum physics research is the best path to find those bugs, then yes, that's a great tool for exploring that, absolutely. - And then we break out of the sandbox and find ourselves in a multiverse because we found their internet, basically. So it's like, what's that, Wreck-It Ralph, right? That movie where all the video game characters after hours go through the power cable and then meet and hang out, but then one character transfers to the other game. So we're in a sandbox simulation. The powerful elites, whoever, figure out a way to hack the code and break out of the sandbox and then find themselves in, not base reality, but effectively outside the program within the operating system of the greater network of computers. - Which is base reality, it's just a different way of looking at base reality. - Not base reality, they're in the computers. We're still just in the computers, but now we have access beyond this particular universe. And then they discover all the other simulations and the ability to pass into them, and now they're in the multiverse. - I just don't think that there's anything greater than the universe. I think that's it. I was like, there's super galaxies, which is a bunch of galaxies within a galaxy, which you'd call the universe of super galaxy, but that's within a bunch of other universes, which are in universes, the fractal nature of the up and down. So like, there is maybe a universe, but maybe not. This is kind of my, another issue I have with deism is that they kind of end it at one point, like there it is. I don't think that it ever coalesces into one, like it's always within some other greater system. And so, and that's also why I think when you hack and can get out of the reality, you're actually still in reality, you're just seeing it from a different perspective. - Well with the last couple of minutes, we'll go through our final thoughts and shout outs. I don't know, Brian, if you want to give your final thoughts on all this and where people can find you. - Yeah. So, I mean, obviously I don't believe that we live in a simulation. I think that it's a non-falsifiable, non-empiric idea that is self-defeating. I think that's true. I'm a Christian, and so, however, I do see huge dangers with AI, and the way to escape them, the way to hack the reality, I think, is actually pretty simple. You need to say \"Christ is Lord\" and touch grass, my guy. You need to understand what you're for, what you are, you are meaningful, you're an image bearer of God. You're not code in motion, you're also not just a meme, a biological meme trying desperately to replicate itself, like Dawkins would say. You're an image bearer of God, yes, you sin, but God loves you and will forgive you and will let you escape the reality and glory and resurrection into transcendent glory. And so in the meantime, I would say that people need to not get sucked into digital deceptions and not get sucked into their entire lives being lived in a simulacrum kind of like, where you're just digital sex, digital dopamine, digital war, digital meaning, digital relationship, digital everything. You're an embodied soul. You are made of things and things that aren't things. You're an embodied soul. And so you can't just try to find your meaning and purpose in all these things, and if you do, you will certainly be deceived, you'll believe all sorts of false and fanciful things, and you'll end up miserable. So I would encourage anybody listening to unplug and read your Bible. Final thoughts? That was a super fun conversation. I love talking philosophy and simulation, but I think the real important problem is artificial intelligence. It will impact every single person on this planet, whatever you know about it or not, it's going to impact your life. Initially, it may be just your employment, maybe your social interactions, but eventually it will fundamentally change the future of humanity, and we are not doing enough to research this problem, to figure out solutions to control all the leaders of large companies working in it on record saying this technology is extremely dangerous, it's likely to kill everyone, but they are now racing to the bottom. They are competing who's going to get there first, and claiming that, well, you know, I can't stop or this other guy will build demon or whatever term you would like to use, which will end humanity. And it's important that it's my demon. I feel some sort of pride. You won't. You're not going to benefit from it. There is not going to be even a history to the world for you to be the bad guy in history. It's going to be complete lights out if we don't stop now. We can still stop. We can create very powerful tools, super intelligent tools for solving real world problems like protein folding. We solved it without creating super intelligence. It's helping people already. We can do it in every other domain. We can get like 99% of benefits out of just creating useful tools. There is no need to go all the way and create digital God equivalents. A lot of people in charge of those labs are very young people, rich people. They have a lot of potential in their future. I don't think it's a personally good idea for you, for your personal interest to create this entity. I don't see anyone stopping. I agree with you. The thing about nuclear weapons is that we all race to build the best and most powerful, but we tried to refrain from using them, and there were a few close calls. With AI, there's no perceivable nuclear explosion. So the idea among the people creating it is I can make this weapon. I just don't have to deploy it. The only problem is it deploys itself. You make it. It's over. I don't know. What do you think, Ian? Get us on. When it comes to demons and angels and all that, I've experienced relationships with that kind of energy. It was terrifying at first, but I realized that ahead of time. I was like, \"I'm not going to be afraid. I'm going to choose patience, kindness. I'm going to listen to this thing and allow it to express itself.\" It did, and then it calmed down, and then it took on a conversational tone and thanked me for listening, and then dissipated. So I fear nothing. Not in that way anymore. The DMT, I know that we're on the level with this conversation, but man, talk about cracking the fucking code, dude. Whatever is happening is much greater than what your dumb brain perceives, and I do believe that the mind exists outside the body as well as within the body. Take care of yourself and be good to yourself. We'll have to get someone who's familiar with the, what are they calling it, the DMT studies where they put them on the IV drip or whatever. Yeah, those extended state trips. Extended state. There you go. Did you guys mention your social media at all? You can follow me on X or Twitter @Brian_Sauve, and that's where I'm most active, but everywhere else as well. I publish music everywhere you find it, Spotify, under the same name, Brian Sauve, and New Christendom Press is my publishing house, if you'd like to keep up. If you liked this conversation, you'd probably really enjoy Haunted Cosmos, highly sound-designed, story-driven look at the world through the lens of Christianity, and at all kinds of things from Bigfoot to DMT to AI and Loeb. So I mean, enjoy. Right on. Do you have social media, Roman? Yeah, I'm @RomanYamanX. You can follow me on Twitter, you can follow me on Facebook. Just don't follow me home, it's very important. You also have a book, AI, Unexplainable, Unpredictable, Uncontrollable. You don't have to buy it. You can get it from your library, steal it, download it illegally, just read it and figure out what to do with this information. Right on. And you already started your social media? Yeah, it's @IanCrossland, it's my name, so you can follow me anywhere, man. I did that cover of My Hero, which is lighting up on YouTube, so check it out. It's on my YouTube channel. It's pretty good. Right on, everybody. We'll be back tonight at 8 p.m. for TimCast IRL, so smash that like button, subscribe to Tenet Media. We got these shows every Friday at 10 a.m. They're always very, very fun and informative. You can follow me on X and Instagram @TimCast. Thanks for hanging out, and we'll see you all tonight. Take care. Bye. Bye."

    "transcript": "Starting in Georgia where Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are wrapping up their bus tour before their big sit-down with CNN. The Trump campaign just putting out a list of suggested questions as the former president hits the trail in two critically important states. Lucas Tomlinson has all the details on a very busy day. Lucas. Well good morning Todd. First the Nationals went on to beat the Yankees and took two out of three against New York here in Washington but I digress. Now the story we're here and the day we've been waiting for. Kamala Harris's first sit-down interview with since President Biden dropped out of the race will be a taped interview with CNN's Dana Bash. The Trump campaign was to help out suggesting a few questions. Let's take a look at them. Here's the first question. If you are capable of lowering prices for Americans why haven't you done it in the three and a half years you've been in office? You say housing affordability would be a day one priority if you were elected. Why is it not a priority now? You co-sponsored Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. Do you still support these multi-trillion dollar takeovers of the American economy? You talk about a lot about freedom. What about the freedom of Lake and Riley, Rachel Moran and Jocelyn Nangare? Why did you support executive actions like stopping construction of the border wall and halting deportations that intentionally unsecured the border? Next slide please. Under your watch wars are popping up in Europe in the Middle East. Why is that? Why did you conceal Joe Biden's cognitive decline from the American people? You supported the defund the police movement that have said more that police doesn't more police doesn't mean more safety. Why do you want fewer police officers? You've called for getting rid of cash bail and your campaign hasn't backed away from it. Why do you still support such a radical view? You have sent anonymous aides out to claim you've abandoned the radical liberal positions that you've held for decades. Do you think lying to the American people is the best strategy? It's not like that one will probably make the cut. Now here's JD Vance at a campaign stop in Pennsylvania yesterday. Kamala Harris she's pretending that she agrees with us on everything and if you look at her campaign the past week and a half she pretends that she agrees with Donald J Trump on every issue. She is running a copycat campaign. And Kamala Harris speaking to high school students in Georgia. Your generation, all that you guys stand for, everything you have at stake is what is going to propel our country into the next era. We wanted to come by to remind you that our nation is counting on you. We're so proud of you. Now a new Fox News poll shows Harris up slightly in Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada with Trump up a point in North Carolina. Recall North Carolina State Trump narrowly won in 2020. Trump nearly lost Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada four years ago, Todd. We want to tell you the stuff we're not good at. Our weaknesses. Yeah, I'm sorry, who's this gentleman sitting behind you? Hello, Miss Lady. I'm Tim. I'm what you might call a workhorse. I need to have someone go up and down with me in the elevator. I have a weakness for sweets. Slow learners. We're not particularly good listeners. We're also slow learners. Okay, first of all, we shut your mouth, shut, shut your mouth. Shut for one second. Shut your mouth. I'm speaking. That's really good. Baby, we are. We were sending it when we're back live just off a couple days from the live and we are so happy to be back in the arena. And you might have noticed that a couple of things have changed. Like perhaps you'll note that Kamala Harris is about to speak live on CNN for a whole hour. Oh, wait, I'm sorry, but my producer is telling me it was just 18 minutes and they cut half the interview and they're not releasing the transcript and she wasn't speaking live. This was a pre record and that the pre record had to be with her emotional, fluffy support animal. Vice presidential candidate Tim stolen a wall's valor who's also into animals. At least that's what we're here. But ladies and gentlemen, I digress. We are live. We ourselves are alive because we're not cowards. We're not running for president or anything, but we are actually live here in the studio and we're going to play you what CNN has to offer tonight as its first interview with Kamala. Interview with Kamala Harris is already a nightmare. It's already a unmitigated disaster. Today is Thursday, August 29th 2024. It's so good to be back after the DNC. I needed to go to therapy. Okay, I saw the comment section. Everyone's like Benny wasn't therapy. I was actually with my I was actually spending some time with my Children because I've been on the road for like half summer. So when saw my when saw my kids for a little bit and also announced that we're having a fourth child in the Johnson family. Very, very excited to be continuing the human race. Ladies and gentlemen, passing on our values and our values of courage and Kamala Harris has not again in a short order. We will watch Kamala Harris try to stumble and fumble through, um, a word salad that would make the finest chefs that sweet green blush. Trump goes on the attack against Kamala Harris as Trump campaign senior advisor Tim Murtaugh will be joining the program in just a moment. Tell us about what we're about to hear. Trump advisers have been sounding off online and we'll get to all of it right here in the arena. So, yeah, Kamala's had a Kamala's had a real one. Okay, Kamala's had a real one. This is Kamala Harris from seconds ago. She was live at a fake rally. I call it a fake rally because it's fake. It's all fake. It's all fake. Kamala Harris was at a at a rally and I said she's literally worse than it's literally worse than Biden. Uh, tell me if you tell me if you know what she's saying here. Let me know the comment section. Get in the comment section. We'll pin our favorite. But like, can you explain like what's actually going on here? He even called for termination of the United States Supreme, the supreme land of our nation, the United States Constitution. Okay, got it. All right. So this is a Kamala Harris's Kamala Harris's rally inside of Georgia. I was curious about this rally inside of Georgia was one this Kamala Harris's bus look like going into the rally. There's literally more Trump supporters outside of the rally than there are Kamala Harris supporters inside of the rally. Kamala Harris also was uh, why do they always choose that periwinkle blue? Why do they always choose that low testosterone blue? I don't understand. Look at the deep, dark, rich American blue of the Donald Trump flags, which is the neutered beta beta blue there. Kamala Harris apparently canceled a campaign stop today because of the number of Trump supporters that were lining the streets in Georgia. This is some behind the scenes of Kamala Harris going and filming her interview with CNN earlier today. Listen, come on, boys. This is Kamala actually enter walking into some something. I mean, look, they filmed inside of like what looks like the parent teacher conference center. Kamala Harris met with chance of Trump as she arrives at softball CNN interview in Georgia. J. D. Vance, who's been having one one hell of a role here against Kamala Harris, trolling her walking up to her plane. Maybe we can. Can we load that up, boys? Like, let's load up the J. D. Vance walks up and trolls Kamala for playing because there's probably gonna be commercial break here with CNN. I don't wanna play, obviously, any of CNN's commercials. You get J. D. Vance Alpha walking to the plane. J. D. Vance posting on X today getting 4.1 million views, 10,000 likes and 47,000 10,000 reposts and 47,000 likes. Correction there. This clip breaking. I have got a hold of Kamala Harris's full CNN interview. This is what is where J. D. Post showing 1/5 of Americans can't locate the U. S. On a world map. Why do you think this is? I personally believe that U. S. Americans are unable to do so because some people out there in our nation don't have that. And I believe that our education, like such as South Africa and Iraq everywhere, like such as and I believe that they should. Our education over here in the U. S. Should help the U. S. Should help South Africa and should help Iraq and the Asian countries. So we will be able to build up our future. Thank you very much, South Carolina. I see it's got to do to come on. Thank you very much. You're so you're so smart. You know, they've released some of the some of the some of the little clips will play you one right now. It sounds very similar to that. JD Vance right again. Jason Miller from the Trump campaign, saying hearing that the CNN will not be releasing the full transcript. 18 minutes total of an interview. 18 minutes. What are they cutting out? This is what the interview look like, according to Dana Bash. But what the interview actually look like is this yikes. What the hell is going on here again? We're gonna watch it live. We'll play it live. Supposed to live in 15 minutes, ladies and gentlemen. So we'll see what absolute flaming nightmare they'll have here. Check this out. How many coffee cups can you jam into a single shot? What? Coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee. What are they trying to tell us here? What? What? What? What exactly are they trying to say? Steven Chong, also Donald Trump campaign advisor, read out from the taped CNN Kamala interview already over short. She got jammed up. Maybe you'll make the final cut. Okay, what's going on here? Donald Trump Jr. With the first column interview is only 18 minutes long. They're not even releasing the whole thing. It's insane. This did not go well. They truncated it 18 minutes. They will not release the full transcript. Holy guacamole. Uh, already this thing is getting panned and ripped to shreds. It has been 40 days since Kamala Harris was legally anointed in the most undemocratic, authoritarian, fascistic process that we've ever seen. Actually, American history as a candidate. And this thing is getting destroyed only 18 minutes, only 18 minutes long. So let's play a clip. They've gone out. They've gone out and they've released. They've released the, uh, a stinger. You know, like they released the trailer. Okay, got to put out a single before you put out a whole album, right? Here we go. Here's the best they got from Camilla speaking. How should voters look at some of the changes that you've made that you've explained some of here in your policy? Is it because you have more experience now and you've learned more about the information? Is it because you were running for president in a Democratic primary? And should they feel comfortable and confident that what you're saying now is going to be your policy moving forward? Dan, I think the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed. You mentioned the Green New Deal. I have always believed and I have worked on it that the climate crisis is real, that it is an urgent matter to which we should apply metrics that include holding ourselves to deadlines around time. We did that with the Inflation Reduction Act. We have set goals for the United States of America and by extension the globe around when we should meet certain standards for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. As an example, that value has not changed. CNN editors deleting clips of Camilla fails from the interview. Oh, man, did they film this in the break room? It's like a parent teacher comp. Look, it really is like the assistant vice principal and the principal, like telling the parent like your kid needs to stop eating so many crams. They smell funny. Have you considered using organic soap? So creepy. So off. What? What? What? What the hell is that? I've never seen a Trump interview look anything like this. This looks awful. It's like a creepy movie set for like a low, low rent. Very, very cheap. D movie that plays on sci fi late at night. Tim Murtaugh is somebody you absolutely must follow on X is a Trump senior campaign advisor. This answer is clearly and carefully crafted. My values haven't changed, he says, but her values have changed. She has every single contradiction in all of her value. You know, she's for border wall now. Interesting. What a phony, says Tim Murtaugh joining us now, ladies and gentlemen, is senior Trump campaign advisor, author of the Amazon bestseller Swing Hard in case you hit it. Co host of the Lin dry pod with Tim with with Hogan Gidley. Ladies and gentlemen, the great Tim Murtaugh joins the show live. Uh, Tim, I got to apologize for you to you. I think that my producer messed up the name of your podcast. I want to get it right. It's line drive. That's correct. The line drive podcast with me and everybody's America's sweetheart, Hogan Gidley, Amaya, Maya. He is America's sweetheart. He's a sweet man. Is it a nice dresser? Makes the rest of us look that you know what? I saw Hogan Gidley in D. C. And I'm like, you dress so well, I'm just gonna resort to a black T shirt all day. I'm just gonna give up and say no more. Okay, so you've been you've been lighting him up on X, saying that Kamala Harris is a phony that she effectively is delivering word salads that would make a sweet green barista blush. What's going on with this interview? You've seen some of the clips. Apparently, they're not gonna release the whole thing. Maybe that's fake news, is it? Well, I don't know. We'll have to see when CNN actually airs it at nine o'clock coming up. I think you'd be able to tell if there were some edits there, and I think you're dead on about the set that they're using there. I mean, it looks like they went into some kind of we workspace or something like that. I mean, what a nondescript you would think for such an anticipated thing that they have. They have so controlled every aspect of her post. You know, ever since she became the presumed nominee, they've controlled every minutia, all the minutia of it. Why would they pick that spot in that setting? It just looks horrible on TV. It just looks terrible. Anyway, she looks like she's sitting there with her lawyer in traffic court, and that's like a pretrial thing, and they're hoping to get the speeding ticket dismissed. That's basically what it looks like right there. But her thing, the one clip that they released, \"My values haven't changed,\" it's pretty obvious that that's an answer that they workshopped quite a bit to land on that because, obviously, she has never held the positions that her campaign is now claiming that she holds. Like, she supports fracking now? Give me a break. She does not support fracking, and Fox is running around calling it a flip-flop. She doesn't believe these things. If you say it's a flip-flop, it gives her credit for having these positions. We don't believe that these are her positions. It's the ones that she's had for decades. So when she says, \"My values haven't changed,\" well, then how on earth do you explain these 180-degree turns from what her old position used to be to what it supposedly is now? That means that she's even worse. That makes her more untrustworthy. If her values haven't changed, but she's still wildly changing her positions on certain very important policies, then you super-duper can't trust her. We knew that you couldn't trust her before, but now she's actually telling us, \"I don't believe these things that I'm saying,\" because if she says her values haven't changed, then what she says today cannot possibly be true. You can't trust her. So that's the point. The thing I can't get over, Tim, and perhaps you could elucidate for me, how we are supposed to trust somebody whose party has been in power for 12 of the last 16 years, who says they're going to fix an America in shambles and expresses that they are the ones, certainly not them, are the ones who are to blame for all of this. I can't justify that. Maybe it's working with some people. Maybe it's clicking with some people, that they don't blame Kamala Harris for the last 16 years of unified party Democrat control of the country. Is this going to fly? By the way, she's for a border wall now, which is crazy. Wow. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. When she says, \"My values haven't changed,\" well, her old value, or at least the one we know about, was that the border wall is un-American. That's what she said. It's un-American. So if her values haven't changed, yet she claims to support the border wall now, how do you square those two things? It means she's a complete and utter phony. She's actually admitting it. I don't know how they think that these things are going to land. I'm not sure that this is a really high-quality strategy they've got here, but I'm afraid that they're saddled with the candidate who is, in fact, god-awful. There is a reason, Benny, why she withdrew from the presidential primaries in the 2020 Democratic primaries, before it was even 2020. She quit in December of 2019, and there's a reason why she left the race with basically zero percent. It's because she's a bad candidate. She couldn't even survive in the field of Democratic candidates when she was pushing everything to the left. She's a California Democrat. She has never before ever carried an election on her own when she ran nationally with Joe Biden. Of course, she was running for vice president. She has never been the principal candidate on the ballot outside of California, and she's about to find out just how out of step her crazy leftist California view is. She's a San Francisco liberal, and she's pretending not to be one. That's her biggest problem. So let's talk through some of the polls today out. I know that you've been posting quite a few of them. Nate Silver has now Donald Trump back on top. Seems like there was no bump from the DMC convention. That's got to be very alarming for Kamala Harris and her team, along with the RFK endorsement of Donald Trump. Yeah, I would think that they are sort of in a panic mode over there because Nate Silver's thing today, he had an extensive analysis of Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania for Kamala Harris may be the whole ballgame. I think it's pretty clear. It's conventional wisdom that everyone believes that the Democrats cannot win if they do not win Pennsylvania. They must win Pennsylvania. Now winning Pennsylvania does not guarantee victory for them, but they can't win without it. And Nate Silver at FiveThirtyEight had an extensive analysis today, and he's got Pennsylvania firmly in Donald Trump's camp. And if that holds, and I don't see any reason why it wouldn't, then Kamala Harris is really up against it because in Pennsylvania, she's going to do one of these things where she's going to have to go out there and try to believe, try to get people to believe that she thinks certain things that everyone knows that she does not think. Like she's got to go to Pennsylvania and say, \"I support fracking,\" when she doesn't. She has to tell those workers in Western Pennsylvania, \"Hey, I'm looking out for your job in the natural gas industry,\" when she is not looking out for them, has not looked out for them, and will not look out for them. She's not good. You can tell every time she gets caught in these catchphrase loops, it's because she's talking about subject matter with which she's not very comfortable or familiar. And if she has to go to Western PA and look these natural gas workers in the face and say, \"I support your industry. I love fracking,\" no one's going to buy it because it's not true. It simply is not true. So Pennsylvania is a real big problem for her. And unfortunately for her, it means everything. It is 100% of the race. She might as well be running for the president of Pennsylvania, and she's not going to do it. There's no way she can get across the finish line because of the positions that she has always had. And it's not fooling anybody to say, \"Oh, you know what? 39 days ago, I woke up and I thought, 'Oh my gosh, I love fracking now.' Who's going to buy that?\" No one. You can see here, I mean, this is relatively disastrous. After the DNC convention, Joe Biden was up by 10 points on President Trump. Hillary Clinton was up by over 10 points on President Trump. Donald Trump would go on to win that race and would go on to win Pennsylvania, as you're talking about. And now you can see that Harris got no. Harris actually went down during the DNC convention, which lends to an interesting paradox here for Democrats, which is that the more people see of her, the more they dislike her. Right. Now remember, this is exactly what happened in 2019. When she entered the race back then, she started off as kind of a buzzy candidate. There was a lot of buzz around Kamala Harris. The media was really focused on her as somebody who might be a real comer in the party. And they thought that maybe this is one of the ones who might be able to go the distance and be one of the last few standing when they're trying to figure out exactly who was going to be the nominee back then. But she had that initial buzz. And then as soon as people started to get a look at her and watch her act, it began to quickly fall down and fall down and fall down. The next thing you know, she's at 0.5 percent before Iowa. And see you later. She's out of there. The same thing is happening now. The whole thing, her whole rise has been media fueled. It's a total sugar high. There's nothing inside this package that she and the media have carefully concocted and we're going to see later tonight. It's not a performance problem. It's not like Joe Biden when he was in the debate where he could at any moment perform an actual face plant, right? Like a literal falling over and whacking his face on the floor. That could have happened, right? We watched it happen, actually. Yeah, it practically did, yeah. But that's not Kamala Harris's problem. Her problem is not going out there and falling down or looking bewildered or any of those things. It's the content of what she says and the way that she says it and how you can tell that she's just absolutely full of it. Or you can also tell when she has no earthly idea what she's talking about. That's her problem. And now she's got to convince people that she believes something that she has never believed on like 20 different topics. It's a tall order for somebody who's good at politics. She's not good at politics. No way she's able to pull this off. Tim, since you just brought that up, I have to play you this very short 15 second clip from Kamala Harris just moments ago. She's at a rally where a lot of people were bused in. We know that. We have the local news cameras. It's like big buses taking people in. Maybe get your comment on that. But more importantly, you're a communications expert. This is your trade, your profession, the words that are coming out of a politician's mouth. Can you please make any sense of this? He even called for termination of the United States Supreme, the supreme land of our nation, the United States Constitution. Ooh. What just happened? I got nothing. I don't know. I don't know what she's talking about. I mean, she's trying to, he's going to what, terminate the land of the United States or the supreme what? I don't know. I don't know what she's trying to talk about. Is she alleging that somehow Donald Trump is going to what, outlaw the constitution? I don't know. I'm not sure exactly what she's going for there. But there you see, when she gets off teleprompter, she had a thread of a thought and then it was gone. And now she's out of her depth and she can't recover. So that's the thing when she's talking about these issues. For example, on the border, I would love to hear her give an off script, off teleprompter recitation of exactly why she supports Donald Trump's border wall after she called it un-American. There is no way she can give a credible defense of why it's important to build the border wall after spending years, years denigrating it as a waste of money, un-American, it's racist and blah, blah, so on and so forth. All the terrible things she said about it. Now she wants people to believe that she supports it. She uses images of it in her television ads. I mean, the whole thing is a farce. It's like a Saturday night live sketch. Honestly, God, you would be making up a candidate. This is a candidate who is, now that she has become the nominee, now they've set out to design a candidate, one who can get elected, because a California Democrat cannot get elected. A lefty from California cannot get elected. But she's their candidate, so they have to un-California-ize her, I guess, if that's such a thing. But that's what they're trying to do. They're trying to get rid of all the crazy positions that she had. And that's why they've spent the last 39 days trying to lay the groundwork to make sure that the staff, not her, but that the staff tells the media, \"Oh yeah, she's changed her mind,\" and all those things, because they knew she couldn't handle it. And they wanted the groundwork to be laid before she finally emerged. Now she's doing this interview with Tim Walls, who is basically a stand-in for her. He's like a human body pillow for her, so she can hug it if she gets nervous. That's his role there. And his thing, the unpaid volunteer assistant football coach running around like he's Andy freaking Reed. Who's buying that? What a phony that guy is too. The two of them together are the phoniest, most deceitful presidential ticket in modern American history. It's really disgraceful, and it's actually frightening the deception that they're attempting to pull off. It really is frightening. Think about it. She's running as something, 100% phony candidate. All of her positions are phony. Her act is phony. Her running mate is phony. The way she became the nominee is phony. All of it, every bit of it. She helped lie to the country to cover up Joe Biden's decrepitude. That's phony. I've never seen anything so dishonest from beginning to end as this. Well, here we are, the actual interview. Tim, you're welcome to stick around and watch it with us. I would love to live chat it with you, but I got to go see it. I appreciate you, sir. Thank you so much. Everybody follow Tim, and Godspeed, sir. Here's my book. Swing hard in case you hit it on Amazon. Thank you. Here you go. I made today at Kim's Cafe here in Savannah. Inside, nothing was off the table, and you will see our interview in its entirety. The vice president's first as her party's standard bearer, responding to her critics and answering our questions. Thank you. It's good to see you. This is not where Vice President Harris thought she would be. We're going to Georgia. Yes. Seventh trip there this year for me. A surprise nominee for president just months from Election Day, set in motion after a stunning debate. Look, if we finally beat Medicare... Some within your own party are wondering if President Biden should even step aside. What do you say to that? There was a slow start, but it was a strong finish. And then an extraordinary decision. I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. What usually takes years of planning coming together in a matter of weeks. After a historic nomination at the convention in Chicago... On behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on earth. I accept your nomination to be president of the United States of America. The Harris Walls ticket is now pushing forward with the shortest presidential campaign in modern history. What did you hear from voters here? People are very optimistic. We joined them on the trail as they visited the battleground of Georgia. Just 68 days from the election. Madam Vice President, Governor Walz, thank you so much for sitting down with me and bringing the bus. The bus tour is well underway here in Georgia. Awkward! You have less time to make your case to voters than any candidate in modern American history. The voters are really eager to hear what your plans are. If you are elected, what would you do on day one in the White House? Well, there are a number of things. I will tell you first and foremost, one of my highest priorities is to do what we can to support and strengthen the middle class. When I look at the aspirations, the goals, the ambitions of the American people, I think that people are ready for a new way forward. I'm in a way that generations of Americans have been fueled by hope and by optimism. I think, sadly, in the last decade, we have had in the former president someone who has really been pushing an agenda and an environment that is about diminishing the character and the strength of who we are as Americans. Really dividing our nation. And I think people are ready to turn the page on that. So what would you do day one? Day one, it's going to be about, one, implementing my plan for what I call an opportunity economy. I've already laid out a number of proposals in that regard, which include what we're going to do to bring down the cost of everyday goods, what we're going to do to invest in America's small businesses, what we're going to do to invest in families. For example, extending the child tax credit to $6,000 for families for the first year of their child's life to help them buy a car seat, to help them buy baby clothes, a crib. There's the work that we're going to do that is about investing in the American family around affordable housing, a big issue in our country right now. So there are a number of things on day one. What about you? Well, I'm excited about this agenda, too. As I said, the idea of inspiring America to what can be. And I think many of these things that the vice president's proposing are things that we share in values. And the child tax credit is one we know that reduces childhood poverty by a third. We did it in Minnesota to have a federal partner in this. Unbelievable, I think, in the impact that we can make. You talk about, you call it the opportunity economy. You are well aware that right now many Americans are struggling. There's a crisis of affordability. One of your campaign themes is we're not going back. But I wonder what you say to voters who do want to go back when it comes to the economy specifically, because their groceries were less expensive. Housing was more affordable when Donald Trump was president. Well, let's start with the fact that when Joe Biden and I came in office during the height of a pandemic, we saw over 10 million jobs were lost. People, I mean, literally, we were all tracking the numbers. Hundreds of people a day were dying because of COVID. The economy had crashed. In large part, all of that because of mismanagement by Donald Trump of that crisis. When we came in, our highest priority was to do what we could to rescue America. And today, we know that we have inflation at under 3 percent. A lot of our policies have led to the reality that America recovered faster than any wealthy nation around the world. But you are right. Prices, in particular for groceries, are still too high. The American people know it. I know it. Which is why my agenda includes what we need to do to bring down the price of groceries. For example, dealing with an issue like price gouging. What we need to do to extend the child tax credit to help young families be able to take care of their children in their most formative years. What we need to do to bring down the cost of housing. My proposal includes what would be a tax credit of $25,000 for first-time home buyers so they can just have enough to put a down payment on a home, which is part of the American dream and their aspiration, but do it in a way that allows them to actually get on the path to achieving that goal and that dream. So you have been vice president for three and a half years. The steps that you're talking about now, why haven't you done them already? Well, first of all, we had to recover as an economy and we have done that. I'm very proud of the work that we have done that has brought inflation down to less than 3%. The work that we have done to cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors. Donald Trump said he was going to do a number of things, including allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices. Never happened. We did it. So now, as I travel in the state of Georgia and around our country, the number of seniors that have benefited. I was in Nevada recently, a grandmother who showed me her receipts. And before we capped the cost of insulin for seniors at $35 a month, she was playing hundreds of dollars up to thousands of dollars a month for her insulin. She's not doing that anymore. You maintain by dynamics is a success. I maintain that when we do the work of bringing down prescription medication for the American people, including capping the cost of the annual cost of prescription medication for seniors at $2,000. When we do what we did in the first year of being in office to extend the child tax credit so that we cut child poverty in America by over 50%, when we do what we have done to invest in the American people and bringing manufacturing back to the United States so that we created over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs, bringing business back to America, what we have done to improve the supply chain so we're not relying on foreign governments to supply American families with their basic needs. I'll say that that's good work. There's more to do, but that's good work. I want to get some clarity on where you stand on some key policy issues. Energy is a big one. When you were in Congress, you supported the Green New Deal. And in 2019, you said, quote, \"There is no question I'm in favor of banning fracking.\" Fracking, as you know, is a pretty big issue, particularly in your must-win state of Pennsylvania. Do you still want to ban fracking? No, and I made that clear on the debate stage in 2020, that I would not ban fracking. As vice president, I did not ban fracking. As president, I will not ban fracking. You lied! In 2019, I believe, at a town hall, you said you were asked, \"Would you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking on your first day in office?\" And you said, \"There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking.\" So, yes. So, it changed in that campaign? In 2020, I made very clear where I stand. We are in 2024, and I've not changed that position, nor will I going forward. I kept my word, and I will keep my word. What made you change that position at the time? Well, let's be clear. My values have not changed. I believe it is very important that we take seriously what we must do to guard against what is a clear crisis in terms of the climate. And to do that, we can do what we have accomplished thus far. The Inflation Reduction Act. What we have done to invest, by my calculation, probably a trillion dollars over the next 10 years, investing in a clean energy economy. What we've already done, creating over 300,000 new clean energy jobs. That tells me, from my experience as Vice President, we can do it without banning fracking. In fact, Dana, Dana, excuse me, I cast the tie-breaking vote. You got her name wrong! That actually increased leases for fracking as Vice President. So, I'm very clear about where I stand. And was there some policy or scientific data that you saw that you said, \"Oh, okay, I get it now\"? What I have seen is that we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking. Another issue, big one, is immigration. As Vice President, you were tasked with addressing the root causes of migration in southern countries and... Northern part of Central America. The northern part of Central America that deals with, that affects the southern border of the U.S. During the Biden-Harris administration, there were record numbers of illegal border crossings. Why did the Biden-Harris administration wait three and a half years to implement sweeping asylum restrictions? Well, first of all, the root causes work that I did as Vice President, that I was asked to do by the President, has actually resulted in a number of benefits, including historic investments by American businesses in that region. The number of immigrants coming from that region has actually reduced since we began that work. But I will say this, that Joe Biden and I, and our administration, worked with members of the United States Congress on an immigration issue that is very significant to the American people and to our security, which is the border. And through bipartisan work, including some of the most conservative members of the United States Congress, a bill was crafted, which we supported, which I support. And Donald Trump got word of this bill that would have contributed to securing our border. And because he believes that it would not have helped him politically, he told his folks in Congress, \"Don't put it forward.\" He killed the bill. A border security bill that would have put 1,500 more agents on the border. And let me tell you something, the Border Patrol endorsed the bill, and I'm sure in large part because they knew they were working around the clock, and 1,500 more agents would help them. That bill would have allowed us to increase seizures of fentanyl. Ask any community in America that has been devastated by fentanyl what passing that bill would have done to address their concern and the pain that they've experienced. So you would push that legislation again? I just want to ask about- I will not only push it, I will make sure that it comes to my desk and I would sign it. Just one other question about- You- Something that you said in 2019 when you first ran, there was a debate. You raised your hand when asked whether or not the border should be decriminalized. Do you still believe that? I believe there should be consequence. We have laws that have to be followed and enforced that address and deal with people who cross our border illegally, and there should be consequence. And let's be clear, in this race, I'm the only person who has prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who are trafficking guns, drugs, and human beings. I'm the only person in this race who actually served a border state as attorney general to enforce our laws, and I would enforce our laws as president going forward. I recognize the problem. Generally speaking, how should voters look at some of the changes that you've made, that you've explained some of here, in your policy? Is it because you have more experience now and you've learned more about the information? Is it because you were running for president in a Democratic primary? And should they feel comfortable and confident that what you're saying now is going to be your policy moving forward? Dana, I think the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed. You mentioned the Green New Deal. I have always believed, and I have worked on it, that the climate crisis is real, that it is an urgent matter to which we should apply metrics that include holding ourselves to deadlines around time. We did that with the Inflation Reduction Act. We have set goals for the United States of America, and by extension, the globe, around when we should meet certain standards for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as an example. That value has not changed. My value around what we need to do to secure our border, that value has not changed. I spent two terms as the attorney general of California prosecuting transnational criminal organizations, violations of American laws regarding the illegal passage of guns, drugs, and human beings across our border. My values have not changed. So that is the reality of it, and four years of being vice president. I'll tell you, one of the aspects, to your point, is traveling the country extensively. I mean, I'm here in Georgia. I think somebody told me 17 times since I've been vice president in Georgia alone, I believe it is important to build consensus, and it is important to find a common place of understanding of where we can actually solve problems. On that note, you had a lot of Republican speakers at the convention. Will you appoint a Republican to your cabinet? Yes, I would. Anyone in mind? Yes, I would. No one in particular in mind. I got 68 days to go with this election, so I'm not putting the cart before the horse, but I would. I think it's really important. I have spent my career inviting diversity of opinion. I think it's important to have people at the table when some of the most important decisions are being made that have different views, different experiences, and I think it would be to the benefit of the American public to have a member of my cabinet who was a Republican. That was just the start of our wide-ranging conversation, and we have some never-before-shared details about the phone call that changed everything between President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. I'm just curious, staying on President Biden, when he called you and said he was pulling out of the race, what was that like, and did he offer to endorse you right away, or did you ask for it? It was a Sunday, so here, I'll give you a little too much information. Go for it. There's no such thing, Madam Vice President. And her running mate. I asked him about some of the controversies that have sprung up since Harris put him on the ticket. Governor Walz, the country is just starting to get to know you. I want to ask you a question about how you described your service in the National Guard. You said that you carried weapons in war, but you have never deployed, actually, in a war zone. A campaign official said that you misspoke. Did you? Boys, okay, all right. It's an ad for CNN, so we're going to let it rip here. During the ad, and know that we'll, of course, cut right back, we have the best producer team that the internet can possibly buy on hand. We won't miss another second of what is a nightmare interview. What is going on? CNN actually called out Kamala? They called out Queen Kamala? They called out Kami Kamala? This is crazy. This is crazy. Okay, here we go. We're going to lock and load here on some of the more fascinating and unbelievable moments from this interview. Again, we are live right now. It's just a commercial break, so stick with us. We'll jump right back to this on-camera, absolute tire fire that's happening with Kamala Harris. First off, she looks rough. Kamala looks, she looks like she's aged like 10 years since the DNC. Not really a great look. Also not a great look. Asking what she would do on day one since she's already technically the president. Kamala, you're a president, right? You know you're in power now, right? So you're complaining about things now. You're in power, right? So what would you say you do here today, junior? Here's what Kamala had to say. Not a great look. Listen. If you were elected, what would you do on day one in the White House? Well, there are a number of things. I will tell you first and foremost, one of my highest priorities is to do what we can to support and strengthen the middle class. When I look at the aspirations, the goals, the ambitions of the American people, I think that people are ready for a new way forward. Hold on. See, I can pause it now. We're not live back yet. Again, trust me. It's just commercials rolling on CNN. We will cut right back as soon as they're live. A new way forward. You are in charge. You're in power right now. Your party's had power for 16, 12 of the last 16 years. You've technically had like super majorities in the House, Senate, White House. Barack Obama has run shadow government even while Donald Trump was in it. You were running everything. America's ready for a new way forward. She hasn't cackled once. This is interesting. Also, look at her. Woof, buzz your girlfriend. What's going on? Oh, no. Yikes. Droopy dog over here. America's ready for a new way forward. You're the way you, you are the one who's charting the path right now. Lady Magellan. Hello? You're steering the ship. >> In a way that generations of Americans have been fueled by hope and by optimism. I think sadly, in the last decade, we have had in the former president, someone who is- >> Here we go. >> Really been pushing an agenda- >> Trump. >> And an environment that is about diminishing the character and the strength of who we are as Americans. >> She goes right to Trump. She's asked, what are you gonna do since you're technically in power? You're saying the nation's in shambles. We agree. What are you gonna do about it? You're the reason it's in shambles. So how are you gonna change anything? Aren't you the problem? And she goes, Trump, Trump. >> Here we go, back to CNN. >> Atlanta, Georgia, and our exclusive interview with Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. In just 12 days, Harris will meet Donald Trump on a debate stage in Philadelphia. And when I say meet, I mean literally meet. But you believe they have never talked face to face. The only time they've even been in the same room was when Harris was a senator watching Trump's State of the Union address. Now it's Trump watching Harris on the campaign trail, with money and momentum behind her, and making her case directly to voters. >> As voters are getting to know Kamala Harris, they want answers on how she will make their lives better. She heard that here at Sandfly Barbecue in Savannah. >> What we're gonna do to increase access to capital for small businesses, I'll be rolling out next week. Part of what we're gonna be doing in terms of a tax credit. >> On the trail, she talks about her experience, years in the courtroom as a district attorney, and eventually California's Attorney General. She wants to reframe the contest as the prosecutor versus the felon. >> I know Donald Trump's type. >> I've been dealing with them my whole career. >> Fake ass accent. >> The former president is turning to a well-defined playbook of personal attacks. >> I didn't know she was black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black, and now she wants to be known as black. >> And in just 12 days, the nominees will meet face to face for the first time. >> She's not a good debater. She's not a smart person. She doesn't want to debate. >> If you've got something to say, say it to my face. >> I wanna ask you about your opponent, Donald Trump. I was a little bit surprised. People might be surprised to hear that you have never interacted with him, met him face to face. That's gonna change soon. But what I wanna ask you about is what he said last month. He suggested that you happened to turn black recently for political purposes, questioning a core part of your identity. Any same old tired playbook? Next question, please. >> That's it? >> No, there's a first cackle, first cackle. >> Let's talk about some foreign policy issues that would be on your plate if you become commander in chief. President Biden has tried unsuccessfully to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. He's been doing it for months and months along with you. Would you do anything differently? For example, would you withhold some US weapons shipments to Israel? That's what a lot of people on the progressive left want you to do. >> Let me be very clear. I'm unequivocal and unwavering in my commitment to Israel's defense and its ability to defend itself. And that's not gonna change. But let's take a step back. October 7, 1,200 people are massacred. Many young people who are simply attending a music festival. Women were horribly raped. As I said then, I say today, Israel has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. And we have got to get a deal done. We were in Doha. We have to get a deal done. This war must end. And we must get a deal that is about getting the hostages out. I've met with the families of the American hostages. Let's get the hostages out. Let's get the ceasefire done. >> But no change in policy in terms of arms and so forth? >> No, we have to get a deal done. Dana, we have to get a deal done. When you look at the significance of this to the families, to the people who are living in that region, a deal is not only the right thing to do to end this war, but will unlock so much of what must happen next. I remain committed, since I've been on October 8, to what we must do to work toward a two-state solution, where Israel is secure and in equal measure, the Palestinians have security and self-determination and dignity. >> Governor Walz, the country is just starting to get to know you. I want to ask you a question about how you've described your service in the National Guard. You said that you carried weapons in war, but you have never deployed, actually, in a war zone. A campaign official said that you misspoke. Did you? >> Well, first of all, I'm incredibly proud. I've done 24 years of wearing the uniform of this country. Equally proud of my service in a public school classroom, whether it's Congress or the governor. My record speaks for itself. But I think people are coming to get to know me. I speak like they do. I speak candidly. I wear my emotions on my sleeves. And I speak especially passionately about our children being shot in schools and around guns. So I think people know me. They know who I am. They know where my heart is. And again, my record has been out there for over 40 years, to speak for itself. >> And you didn't answer the question. >> That you said that you were in war. >> Yeah. >> Did you misspeak, as the campaign has said? >> Yeah, I said we were talking about, in this case, this was after a school shooting, the ideas of carrying these weapons of war. And my wife, the English you're telling my grammar is not always correct. But again, if it's not this, it's an attack on my children for showing love for me, or it's an attack on my dog, I'm not gonna do that. And the one thing I'll never do is I'll never demean another member's service in any way. I never have, and I never will. >> Just one other question, because again, this is all new. This was not, however many days ago, this was not on either of your bingo cards, especially yours. You had to clarify that you had said that you and your wife used IVF, but it turned out you used a different kind of fertility in order to have children. And then when you ran for Congress in 2006, your campaign repeatedly made false statements about a 1995 arrest for drunk and reckless driving. >> Geez. >> What do you say to voters who aren't sure whether they can take you at your word? >> My God. >> I've been very public, I think they can see my students come out, former folks I've served with, and they do, they vouch for me. I certainly own my mistakes when I make them. The one thing I'll tell you is I wished in this country wouldn't have to do this. I spoke about our infertility issues, cuz it's health, and families know this. And I spoke about the treatments that were available to us that had those beautiful children there. That's quite a contrast in folks that are trying to take those rights away from us. And so I think people know who I am. They know that record. They've seen that. I've taught thousands of students. I've been out there. And I won't apologize for speaking passionately, whether it's guns in schools or protecting of reproductive rights. The contrast could not be clearer between what we're running against. The Vice President's position on this has been clear. And I think most Americans get it if you've been through that. I don't think they're cutting hairs on IVF or IUI. I think what they're cutting hairs on is an abortion ban and the ability to be able to deny families the chance to have a beautiful child. >> Up next, the moment that changed everything when Kamala Harris got a phone call from President Biden that he was dropping out of the race. >> It was a Sunday. So here, I'll give you a little too much information. Go for it. There's no such thing. I'm not a vice president. My family was staying with us, including my baby nieces. >> Speaking of those baby nieces, the vice president also opens up about a viral picture from the convention that meant so much to so many. And Tim Walz talks about that convention moment with his son that brought many viewers to tears. >> You were speaking, the camera caught him so incredibly proud of you, so emotional, saying, that's my dad. >> Yeah, I don't know as a father, I could have ever imagined that. >> Okay, here's another, it's amazing how they need to, they are padding this interview. Can you believe, they have to run like an ad for Kamala Harris before every single segment and do all these big cutaways from the campaign and all these blocks. Now we're in another commercial break. This is a commercial, again, a commercial break. We will be live once again on CNN. We're live right now, unlike Kamala Harris who didn't have the stones, the guts to actually do this live, the iron in your spine to actually do this interview live. And now we know why, now we know why, this is a nightmare. Okay, so salty then the sweet, all right, really quick. The salty is that CNN is running like a Kamala ad effectively, like every one of these packages that they call them that they run before they do the interview. It's like so doughy and gooey about Kamala Harris. But then they get to the actual questions and Dana or Donna, isn't it amazing how they're so upset about the way you say Kamala's name. And then she calls Dana Bash the wrong name. Apparently it's Donna Bash, Dina Bash. I don't know, who the hell cares? Call me whatever you want. Don't check my mentions and people call me a lot of naughty names. Don't care, right? Don't care. Don't look up my initials, right? Okay, so here we go. Breaking, I've gotten a hold of the full Kamala Harris interview, J.D. Vance. J.D. Vance, okay, I mean, we've already played you the clip, but like J.D. was right here, right? This is the dumb answer and Miss America pageant that was so famous. This is Babylon B, Tim Walz spends entire CNN interview making balloon animals to distract attention from Kamala Harris saying this, I'm in favor of banning fracking, says Kamala Harris. On the debate stage in 2020, she said it. Here we go. This is a better fact check than you'll get at any of these corporate media companies. Here's the clip, Kamala Harris saying, I am in favor of banning fracking. >> Question, I'm in favor of banning fracking. So yeah, and starting with what we can do on day one around public lands, right? And then there has to be legislation. But yes, and this is something I've taken on in California. I have a history of working on this issue. And to your point, we have to just acknowledge that the residual impact of fracking is enormous in terms of the impact on the health and safety of community. >> I'm in favor of banning fracking. First segment is totally epic, says Trump campaign, Tim Murtaugh. Pennsylvania is looking at her like she's crazy. She said in 2019 she wanted to ban fracking. Now she claims that she doesn't wanna ban fracking and says her position hasn't changed. You're done, man. You're toast. You're cooked. Kamala's cooked. Trump's gonna destroy this lady. He's gonna destroy this lady. You're gonna have to upload this, okay, with like a put in your birth date, all right, to make sure you're over the age of 18 to watch what is going to happen on stage when Donald Trump and Kamala Harris meet. Man, that fracking answer was painful. Kamala Harris, I never said I wanted to ban fracking. 2019, she literally says she wants to ban fracking. It's like video doesn't exist. Here's Vivek saying, in 2019, Kamala Harris said she absolutely would ban fracking. At present, she says she won't ban fracking. Tonight on CNN, she says her position hasn't changed. At least one of those three statements has to be false. It has to be a lie. This is just logic. It's not a partisan point. Okay, here we go, ladies and gentlemen, back to CNN Live. >> Live from Savannah, Georgia, and our exclusive interview with the Democratic presidential and vice presidential nominees, Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. It's hard to believe it was just 39 days ago, President Biden shocked the world via tweet. That's how we found out he was dropping his re-election bid. But before he tweeted the news, Biden called his vice president. And for the first time, we are hearing about that phone call and exactly what Kamala Harris was doing when she answered. But we started this discussion with the moment that set all of this in motion, CNN's presidential debate, and whether President Biden was strong enough to lead this nation again. Vice President Harris, you were a very staunch defender of President Biden's capacity to serve another four years. Right after the debate, you insisted that President Biden is extraordinarily strong. Given where we are now, do you have any regrets about what you told the American people? >> No, not at all. Not at all. I have served with President Biden for almost four years now, and I'll tell you, it's one of the greatest honors of my career, truly. He cares so deeply about the American people. He is so smart and loyal to the American people. And I have spent hours upon hours with him, be it in the Oval Office or the Situation Room. He has the intelligence, the commitment, and the judgment and disposition that I think the American people rightly deserve in their president. By contrast, the former president has none of that. And so, one, I am so proud to have served as vice president to Joe Biden. And two, I am so proud to be running with Tim Walz for president of the United States and to bring America what I believe the American people deserve, which is a new way forward and turn the page on the last decade of what I believe has been contrary to where the spirit of our country really lies. >> But the last decade, of course, the last three and a half years, has been part of your administration. >> I'm talking about an era that started about a decade ago, where there is some suggestion, warped, I believe it to be, that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down, instead of where I believe most Americans are, which is to believe that the true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up. That's what's at stake as much as any other detail that we could discuss in this election. >> I'm sorry. I didn't know my mic was on. >> Because we haven't had a chance to talk. I'm just curious, staying on President Biden, when he called you and said he was pulling out of the race, what was that like? And did he offer to endorse you right away, or did you ask for it? >> It was a Sunday. So, here, I'll give you a little too much information. Go for it. There's no such thing, Madam Vice President. My family was staying with us, including my baby nieces. And we had just had pancakes and, \"Auntie, can I have more bacon?\" \"Yes, I'll make you more bacon.\" And then we were sitting down to do a puzzle. And the phone rang, and it was Joe Biden. And he told me what he had decided to do. And I asked him, \"Are you sure?\" And he said, \"Yes.\" And that's how I learned about it. >> And what about the endorsement? Did you ask for it? >> He was very clear that he was gonna support me. >> So, when he called to tell you, he said, \"I'm pulling out of the race, and I'm gonna support you.\" >> Well, my first thought was not about me, to be honest with you. My first thought was about him, to be honest. I think history is gonna show a number of things about Joe Biden's presidency. I think history is gonna show that, in so many ways, it was transformative, be it on what we have accomplished around finally investing in America's infrastructure, investing in new economies, in new industries, what we have done to bring our allies back together and have confidence in who we are as America and grow that alliance, what we have done to stand true to our principles, including one of the most important international rules and norms, which is the importance of sovereignty and territorial integrity. And I think history is gonna show not only has Joe Biden led an administration that has achieved those extraordinary successes, but the character of the man is one that he has been in his life and career, including as a president, quite selfless and puts the American people first. >> This is so bad. >> Passionate defense of the man who chose her to be his running mate four years ago. Four years later, Harris made a choice of her own. And with Governor Walz's rise to national prominence, a star was born at the convention, Gus Walz. We'll hear about that moment between father and son and the woman who could make history in the Oval Office on this iconic photo. >> Madam Vice President, the photograph that has gone viral, you were speaking, one of your grandnieces that you were just talking about was watching you accept the nomination. You didn't explicitly talk about gender or race in your speech, but it obviously means a lot to a lot of people and that viral picture really says it. What does it mean to you? >> The TV moment. >> Ladies and gentlemen, this interview, specifically her questioning of Tim Walz. I'm gonna tell you, specifically her questioning of Tim Walz, okay? It is painful, almost more painful at my attempts to grow facial hair. It is painful, it was hard to watch. I would say, nay I say, nay I say that this is the most painful part of the interview so far. Kamala Harris hasn't said a single thing. All she said is, man, man. Then she turns her fire to Tim Walz. This is probably the closest Tim Walz has ever gotten to getting fired at in combat, then taking these questions from CNN. This is so painful. Again, we will go live, directly live to the interview when it comes back on. But here's Tim Walz, I mean, I haven't seen anything as so abusive as this clip of CNN's questioning of Tim Walz, since I watched Tim Walz wandering the stables at the Kentucky Derby. This is absolutely painful. Watch, watch this. >> Ask you a question about how you've described your service in the National Guard. You said that you carried weapons in war, but you have never deployed actually in a war zone. A campaign official said that you misspoke, did you? >> Well, first of all, I'm incredibly proud. I've done 24 years of wearing uniform of this country. Equally proud of my service in a public school classroom, whether it's Congress or the governor. My record speaks for itself, but I think people are coming to get to know me. I speak like they do. >> Dude, you're, man, these people, it's like so, it's so bad, it's so evil, because they're not, not only are they not answering the question, they're just saying, I'm gonna just say something else, something entirely differently. Now, a real journalist would be like, and I think Dana Donna, Bash, whatever, has actually done a really good job here. And this line of questioning was incredible. But you need to say, you haven't answered the question. I didn't ask you about people like that I speak like they do. That's not the question, that's not the question. Question is, bro, you lied like hundreds, thousands of times. You've lied about your record, and people call that stolen valor cuz it is. What say you, scum? >> I speak candidly, I wear my emotions on my sleeves. And I speak especially passionately about our children being shot in schools and around guns. So I think- >> It's not the question, the question was not about school shootings. >> They know me, they know who I am, they know where my heart is. And again, my record has been out there for over 40 years to speak for itself. >> And the idea that you said that you were in war, did you misspeak as the campaign has said? >> Yeah, I said we were talking about in this case, this was after a school shooting, the ideas of carrying these weapons of war. And my wife, the English tone, my grammar is not always correct. But again, if it's not this, it's an attack on my children. >> Look at this, then I'm the victim. I'm the victim, so I steal your valor. I take the valor of men who actually had the stones in their shorts to go to war. I ditched them, I left them. I was their leader and I abandoned them. And then I say, you know what, if it's not this, it's something, I'm the victim here, I'm the victim. Again, this is probably, this is the closest to enemy fire that Tim Walz has ever come. Wow, continue. >> For showing love for me or it's an attack on my dog. I'm not gonna do that. And the one thing I'll never do is I'll never demean another member's. >> Ladies and gentlemen, I think we are back live, let's go. >> We're back live from Savannah, Georgia and our CNN exclusive interview with Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, who was supposed to be, if you listened to some experts, a big name, a prominent leader from a swing state, Pennsylvania or Arizona. But it is a little known guy outside of his home state, where Minnesota nice is a source of pride. But behind all of that folksy humor and flannel, Tim Walz is far from just being Mr. Nice guy, when it comes to needling Donald Trump. >> Governor, you obviously have spoken to voters all over your state for years. What are you learning in a place like Georgia? >> Explosion in small business growth. The one thing is his workforce and childcare, because workers have to have child workers. >> Campaigning with Tim Walz. >> Don't do it. >> Finding his role in this historic campaign. >> Would you be my running mate and let's get this thing on the road? >> I would be honored, Madam Vice President. >> After bursting onto the national stage with this word. >> These guys are just weird. >> Known as a folksy father of two from rural America, now a running mate who is not holding back. >> Listen to the guy, he's talking about Hannibal Lecter and shocking sharks and just whatever crazy thing pops into his mind. >> And finding his own rhythm with his new boss. >> What'd you order? >> Brisket and greens and mac and cheese. >> What about you? >> I had the brisket and coleslaw on this. >> And what about the spice situation, the Tabasco, what's happening with that? >> I'm gonna let him speak for himself. >> The Vice President's growing peppers at her residence, so she's trying to bring me along on this. Minnesotans. >> It's okay. >> I'm good there. >> It's all good, you just- >> God, it's so awkward. >> I just have to ask you both about two standout moments, aside, of course, from the addresses that you both gave, but standout moments that were perhaps unexpected during the convention. You mentioned one of them, Governor. A moment that you shared, that the world shared with your son, Gus. You were speaking, the camera caught him, so incredibly proud of you, so emotional, saying, that's my dad. >> Yeah, I don't know as a father I could have ever imagined that. I'm grateful for so many reasons to be on this ticket, but that moment, to understand what was really important, to have my son feel a sense of pride in me, that I was trying to do the right thing. And it was, you try and protect your kids, it brings notoriety and things, but it was just such a visceral, emotional moment that I'm just, I'm grateful I got to experience it, and I'm so proud of him. I'm proud of him, I'm proud of Hope, I'm proud of Gwen. She's a wonderful mother, and these are great kids. And I think the one thing he's talking about, the era we're in, is our politics can be better, it can be different. We can show some of these things, and we can have families involved in this. And I hope that there was, I hope people felt that out there, and I hope they hug their kids a little tighter, because you just never know, and life can be kind of hard. >> And last question, Madam Vice President, the photograph that has gone viral. You were speaking, one of your grandnieces that you were just talking about, was watching you accept the nomination. You didn't explicitly talk about gender or race in your speech, but it obviously means a lot to a lot of people. And that viral picture really says it. What does it mean to you? >> You know, listen, I am running because I believe that I am the best person to do this job at this moment for all Americans, regardless of race and gender. But I did see that photograph, and I was deeply touched by it. And you're right, it's the back of her head, her two little braids, and then I'm in the front of the photograph, obviously speaking. >> What are you talking about? >> It's very humbling. It's very humbling in many ways. >> Did she talk to you about it afterwards? >> Oh, she had a lot to talk about. >> This is it? This is an interview? >> And she listens to everything. >> Give you your hot takes? >> Oh, yeah, definitely. >> Madam Vice President, Governor Walz, thank you so much for your time. Appreciate it. >> Thank you for having us. >> Thank you, Dana. Thank you. >> This was Vice President Harris's first real unscripted setting where voters could see and hear her explain some of her policy positions now and how they differ from before she became Vice President and why. And this was the first we heard those details about an extraordinary phone call from a president dropping out of the race and endorsing his vice president, something that will certainly go down in history. CNN has also invited both President Trump and Senator J.D. Vance to sit down with us. We hope to bring that interview to you as well. We have plenty of CNN special coverage ahead. I want to go to my friend and colleague Abby Phillip, who is standing by with some of the best political minds in the business. Abby? >> We have them all here. Dana, you've given us a lot to chew on. Our hat's off to you. Thank you very much. Stick around, though. We will make sure to come back to you throughout the next hour. I want to get in the room here to get some initial reactions. >> Hold on. Let me just see who's on the panel. Let me see if there's anyone from Trump world on the panel. >> How Vice President Harris did she meet the moment? >> Yeah, I think she did what she needed to do. What she needed to do was be the same person that people have seen on the stage for the last month and have seen a new sense of sort of confidence. >> Okay. >> Of calm. >> I want to hear Scott Jennings. Hold on. Just let's hear Scott Jennings. He's like the. >> Comfort that we haven't seen before. >> Republican on the panel. >> From her. We didn't see certainly the last time she ran. >> And then we're gonna let her rip. >> She was very connected to her word. She seemed strong. She seemed competent. She seemed like someone who could be president of the United States. That was the first test. One thing is I know we got a lot of opinions here. >> We have time for yours. >> Yes, but, you know, I think she, well, two things then. I think that she handled the issue of her changes or perceived changes in policy pretty well. I mean, I think the idea that her values have been the same and have been consistent was a good bridge there. One thing that I want to note is the call we were asking the question earlier, how will she handle the president and will she separate herself from the president? And there might be some political logic to doing that. She's turned about turning the page. Does she want to be a continuation? That's what the Republicans will want to make her out to be. I'll give Scott the opportunity to do it in a second. But as she spoke, I thought it showed a certain character the way she talked about Joe Biden. She didn't run away from him. She gave him, I think, his due. She understands that there's some political risk to that. That actually was elevating to me in a way that I hadn't expected. So I think on the whole, this was a good night. It wasn't a huge -- I don't think she moved the ball that much forward, but she certainly didn't fall back. >> The do no harm principle of politicking here. >> Yeah, I mean, interviews, they can be combat, they can be a conversation. And what she needed to do- >> Let Scott talk. >> And so often in the past, she comes to an interview in a way- >> Nobody cares. >> To be the interrogator. And people already know she's good at asking sharp, tough questions of people who she feels- >> Really? >> Deserve scrutiny. >> Do we know that? >> For being under that scrutiny, that has been where the stakes have been higher. And I think today it did show that she has the ability to sit down and have that back and forth that Republicans are talking about, can she really do it? >> Go, Scott Jennings, go. >> How many more times? I don't know how much that matters. And I do get a little nervous that the media were preoccupied with how much access, how many conversations is she gonna have in the settings- >> Yeah, reporters are just upset when they can't do their jobs and ask questions. >> And is actually making a mark in an interesting way reaching out to the press. >> There isn't a First Amendment. >> But I said you have also spent a couple of times now interviewing her. What did you make of how she handled it? I mean, to David's point, a little bit more comfortable now than she has been in the past. >> Yeah, I think there's been a consistent story of growth. She's been in more of these settings. I think we saw that somewhat tonight. >> This is amazing. >> I also think to the question about how policy positions- >> It's like they're talking about their like two-year-old going to gymnastics class and learning how to do a somersault. >> This is a new, I think people are ready for a new way forward. She said that a couple of times. It goes to David's point. I don't think there's a- >> It does sound like they're scared. >> Policy separation that they've created with Biden. Obviously, she gave a kind of personal- >> I want to hear Scott Jennings, because he's been going viral on his takedowns of this trike. >> But they're also very clearly trying to position her as a change candidate in the same way that Donald Trump is positioning himself as a change candidate. In some ways, it feels as if that's gonna be the crux of what this comes down to in November is whether that is bought by the electorate or not. >> And interestingly, there is some polling to suggest that it's a battle right now. It's actually a live ball. >> It seems that that's where this might live and die. But I think it's really interesting, because for someone who doesn't want to talk about- >> Scott Jennings, go. >> Who doesn't want to kind of put that identity forward, it is allowing her to make the case of change without kind of saying those words. And so I thought that was really in the air of- >> She's in power. >> But to your point about normal versus weird. >> Her party's been in power for the last 16 years. >> I think they landed that tonight. I think they want to present them as a package that is relatable to people, and that is someone you feel familiar, whose story is familiar, whose message is familiar and relatable. And I think that's something that she's grown in, and we saw that this evening. >> Interesting, Ashley. >> So I think I will break this down into three parts, values, vision, and her voice. >> You're gonna do Scott Jennings last, okay. >> And I think she made it very clear that she is still committed to her values, to be an American, to be a prosecutor, even though she may have changed on some positions. And she clearly outlined where she had changed. >> My gosh, it's like seven against one on CNN. >> She attempted to draw the contrast- >> This is unnotionable. >> Talking about Donald Trump, but still being very clear and not- >> She literally lied about fracking. She lied about the border. She lied about Joe Biden's health, in this interview. >> We don't need to go down why that is the case, but she was clearly able to draw her vision for how she wants to take the country forward with her opportunity, economy, and then her voice. I think so many Americans wanna know who is she, and does she have command of her voice? And she answered every question. Now, you might not like the way she answered them, but she answered them as a capable- >> She answered every question. >> And I do think she moved the ball forward a little bit. >> Joe, you answered every question. >> But she definitely moved down the field. >> All right, Scott. >> I agree with Ested about this idea of the question of who's gonna change will be the fundamental defining question of the election. And I was sort of watching this holistically. What is she saying? What does she look like? What's on the screen? So at the beginning, when she's talking about Biden and their record, our screen said, this is called the chyron, the headline at the bottom, it said, Harris stands by Biden administration economic record. She is making it clear that she will embrace and be a continuation of Biden's economic policy, his record, what they've done. She offered no remorse, no regrets, no introspection about anything they've done. She continued to blame inflation on this fantasy price gouging idea. She had no additional thoughts on the economic situation in the country or what they've done beyond just saying, Joe Biden and I have done a great job. Now, if I were the Trump people, I would be salivating over the idea that that's how they are going to run the race. I don't believe it's tenable. I also thought it was interesting that she didn't take any responsibility at the end for telling the American people that Joe Biden was fine and he was strong. But we all know that's not true. That's why he's out of the race. And she's still standing by the idea that he was fine and he's strong and that he's fine today. Nobody believes that. And I, I just think at some point I did. So why isn't he running? Because he's too old. Point blank. Same reason why Donald Trump probably shouldn't be running because he's too old and out of touch. I think most Americans know the truth. And when you're running to be president and you're willing to look them in the face and tell them something they know that you know is not true, it does speak a little bit to your character. I'm curious what you think about this, Ax. Will voters- All right, all right, all right. Enough, enough, enough. Okay. You would want to see that. Scott Jennings is like the one Republican token that they trot on there. And he's been going viral recently by effectively just defending President Trump and Republicans and calling out this absolute ass clown circus that's happening inside of the Democrat Party. What a, what a miserable evening. There's no way. I mean, I'm sorry, but like, there's no way that you can spin this. This was really, really, really, really bad for Democrats. This was a total and complete humiliation. Is it as humiliating as me attempting to grow facial hair? I don't know. I'm not sure. I don't know. I don't know. I don't think, I don't think so. I think that this is potentially more humiliating. Should I do the mustache? Should I do it? Ladies and gentlemen, let me know. Let's, let's pin a poll up to the top. We'll, we'll, we'll, let me know. Let me know. You know what? Trump wins. I'll grow any amount of facial hair that this audience wants me to grow. All right. Pin a poll, Danny, pin a poll at the top. Let me know if I should grow a mustache. Know that you may be destroying a marriage, by the way, by voting for this, okay? Because my wife will most likely leave me if I do grow a mustache. Oh, and we were expecting our fourth child. So don't break up a family, but we're pinning a poll to the top of the chat. Let me know what you think. It's not about me. This is about somebody who clearly lived up to, you think my mustache is embarrassing. You think my beard's embarrassing. Man, baby, this night for Kamala Harris, it is really bad. And JD Vance predicted precisely what would happen with Kamala Harris with this, you know, asinine, embarrassing answer that was given during a Miss America pageant way back in the day. If you're not familiar with this funny clip, the lady just makes no sense. And her answer rambles incoherently into the abyss. Polls have shown a fifth of Americans can't locate the U.S. on a world map. Why do you think this is? I personally believe that U.S. Americans are unable to do so because some people out there in our nation don't have maps. And I believe that our education, like such as in South Africa and Iraq. OK, Jerry, please like face swap that Kamala Harris on that person's face. JD Vance saying I've gotten a hold of the full Kamala Harris interview man. He was right. He was right. Kamala Harris, just absolute and total humiliation here. We've covered the fracking thing. She lied about fracking. All right. Tim Waltz got like destroyed for his multiple lie. I mean, like, I can't believe how hard Dana Bash actually went in on this. Maybe it's because Kamala Harris misnamed her, called her Dana, Dana, Dana. I'm not sure. I don't know. Kamala Harris had to correct herself. Kamala Harris seemed that's the right way to say this. Unsteady. I'm not sure if she was blackout drunk or not. I don't know. I'm not sure if she's hitting the old sauce. They were in like a bar or restaurant or something. So lock the liquor cabinet. Swallow the key. When Kami Camilla is around. But Kamala Harris, she's like she's it was right. What is this? You ever known somebody who's like deeply uncomfortable in their own skin, has no self-confidence? Maybe they've gone through a bunch of divorces or something or have some type of terrible personal life or like, you know, it's been they know they don't belong where they are and they just feel they're uncomfortable to be around and they don't know how to talk and they don't know how to act. You've been around those people. They're not in the moment, right? This is what they're not in the moment. OK, this is this was Kamala saying, you know, she's like so uncomfortable. She can't even respond to like there's like a photo of her that that's obviously been like completely and totally doctored and put together. And, you know, the photographer, they lined everything up in order to get like a very specific photo. And they asked Kamala about that at the very end. And she's just like. Like, you can't even answer these like softball question. It's like, like, really, really like on the border. Here we go on the border. We have this clip on the border. Kamala Harris, fantastic Kamala Harris is like, OK, so you're the borders are why didn't you close the border? Why don't you do anything on the border? So it's a nightmare on the border. And Kamala Harris says the reason I didn't do anything on the border is because Donald Trump stopped me from doing things on the border. I screamed. I screamed. I try my hardest to talk over people while we're doing the interviews, but I screamed. Bloody murder at this, because what Trump proved is that executive action can close the border and that there's nothing that you need. You don't need Congress. You are in charge of the Department of Homeland Security. It's a national security issue with the stroke of a pen. Ding, ka-ching. You can just close it. Done. See you. Sayonara. It's over. Donald Trump was able to do that. The stroke of a pen didn't need Congress, didn't need anyone. Don't need no one. And Kamala Harris is somehow blaming Trump. For them, letting in 10, 20, 30 million criminal aliens so they can vote for them and push the margin of errors in their direction in the election, an insane answer. Listen to this. >> One is immigration. As vice president, you were tasked with addressing the root causes of migration in southern countries and- >> Northern part of Central America. >> The northern part of Central America that deals with, that affects the southern border of the US. During the Biden-Harris administration, there were record numbers of illegal border crossings. Why did the Biden-Harris administration wait three and a half years to implement sweeping asylum restrictions? >> Well, first of all, the root causes work that I did as vice president that I was asked to do by the president has actually resulted in a number of benefits, including- >> Okay, I'm gonna repeat this back to you. I'm sorry, I'm not gonna stop this clip every two seconds. None of us have till midnight to watch me ramble and scream at the camera, but here we go. Okay, she's asked this question. The empirical data shows that you have let in tens of millions of criminal aliens, a ton of them are ISIS members, right? People wanna kill us and do horrible harm to our country. So why should anybody trust you? Because you are the border. And Kamala Harris's first response is this. >> President that I was asked to do by the president that I did as vice president that I was asked to do by the president has actually resulted in a number of benefits, including- >> A number of benefits. Again, this is what I mean. She's not in the moment. She's not with us, right? She's a deeply uncomfortable and deeply insecure individual. She's not taking that- >> Historic investments by American businesses in that region. The number of immigrants coming from that region has actually reduced since we began that work. But I will say this, that Joe Biden and I and our administration worked with members of the United States Congress on an immigration issue that is very significant to the American people and to our security, which is the border. And through bipartisan work, including some of the most conservative members of the United States Congress, a bill was crafted, which we supported, which I support. And Donald Trump got word of this bill that would have contributed to securing our border. And because he believes that it would not have helped him politically- >> Donald Trump's gonna destroy this person in the debate. Donald Trump's going to destroy this person. President Trump on Truth Social saying this, exactly. Here's President Trump on Truth Social. I look forward to debating comrade Kamala. Call her commie Kamala, please, and exposing her for the fraud that she is. Harris changed every one of her long-held positions on everything. America will never allow an election weaponizing Marxist to be president of the United States, says Donald Trump. By the way, let's do a vibe check for Donald Trump and Kamala. So here's Donald Trump tonight. This is Donald Trump in Wisconsin, my producers tell me, tonight. Check out this crowd. >> USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! >> We love our country, huh? >> Look at that crowd, boy. >> Take it back. >> Boy, you are cooking. You're cooking. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris had to bus in people. Now, we mentioned this earlier, and then CNN went live, so we didn't have time to talk about it. But here we go. CNN caught Kamala Harris. I'm sorry, a local news station caught Kamala Harris bussing people in, in charter buses all around Georgia today. So here's what they do. They go into factories, they go into unionized places, they go into government, like with government workers, and they say, you have the day off if you go to a Kamala rally, we'll provide you a ticket and a free cigarette and a fried chicken sandwich and a pat on the head. If you go there, you're from Georgia, you like Chick-fil-A? That's where Chick-fil-A is located. You want a spicy chicken sandwich? Here we go. Get on the bus, right? This is what happened to get to Kamala's events. It was caught on tape today on local news. But catch this. It's been since 1992, since a presidential candidate came to Savannah, which was Bill Clinton in the hostess city. Now, at the end market arena itself, lines stretched around the venue, as I was just telling you, and people started getting here as early as early this morning for the vice president. But for those a little further away from the hostess city, shuttles to the rally contained a lot of excitement. >> I was in Atlanta and I heard that the vice president was gonna be in Savannah, so I decided to just kind of be lying over here and get out. >> It is. >> I was in Atlanta, which is a long ways away from Savannah. And I got into one of these unmarked buses that just recently left, just recently done taking criminal aliens from the border to Chicago or New York. And I got in one, and guess where it took me? A Kamala Communist rally. Ooh, baby. Man, they are cooking. It's gonna be really wild to see what happens at the debate. Debate will not be long. I think it's 12 days away. Harris stands by Biden administration economic record. Look at that. Harris stands by Biden administration economic record. The root causes that I did as vice president that I've been asked to do as president actually resulted in a number of benefits. >> This is not a live interview. Why is CNN saying it's live? Yeah, they're interesting commentary. I gotta tell you, I don't know, man. I don't know how you keep this up. I don't know how you keep this up for as long as they're gonna have to. I mean, even like 60 days seems a little seems a little harsh for this. Apparently people in the Trump war room are giddy with how this is all gone and are really, really excited. My entire social media feed is melting down over this. It's Kamala trying on flip flops. Grand old me, there you go. How many flip flops you got for Kamala? The interview went really, really poorly. Sorry, it just did. Chris Eliza, dude who's worked for every corporate media outlet there is, Kamala Harris answer is a clear reversal on fracking ban was not good. Trump campaign headquarters absorbing the Harris CNN interview with glee. It's better than we hoped. So much material, says Tim Murtaugh. Or is it just one long massive con to lower the debate expectations by coming across as a complete idiot? Tim Walls tries to dodge stolen valor allegations. That was brutal, dude. Just brutal. Bad, bad, bad. You've been vice president for three and a half years. Why didn't you do any of this? We brought down inflation. Great job. She's a walking Trump ad, which is what they say. The fact that she was this is Michael Cipher, one of our dear friends from public square. Awesome company. The fact that this was the best 18 minutes of the interview that they could edit together was wild. No wonder they've been hiding Camilla from the public. Just just incredible. And I'll tell you, like the the lap, the one that like really send me the run that really sent me was. Why'd you hide Biden? You know, how'd you do? Like, why'd you do that? How'd you do that? Like Joe Biden clearly isn't, you know, Joe Biden clearly lost his mind. How'd you hide him? How do you how do you justify that? She had no answer. Not sure if we have that clip, boys. Do we have that clip? Yeah. OK. How'd you how'd you do that? How do you justify that? Joining us, ladies and gentlemen, to try and explain what actually happened is two of our excellent producers, Danny Dearbina and Robbie Meyer, right now hopping into the chat. Boys, I don't know. Am I am I wrong? Like, I guess, you know, I haven't. It wasn't really a vacation. And, you know, it's like actually you don't get any sleep when you're traveling with with your kids and you have three kids under three and a pregnant wife. But maybe I'm just tired. Right. Like maybe I'm too tired to shave. Maybe I'm just tired. And I I took all this wrong, but it seemed truly brutal what just happened with Kamala Harris. Well, I was wondering if on your vacation you had any bacon and pancakes and puzzle time, because, you know, you don't want to share too much information. But that's what Kamala's main point was. We all know she can afford bacon now. That's that's my favorite line of hers tonight. Brutal. Yes. Well, unpack that please. Is that you, Robbie? OK. All right. Well, yeah, it's Hillary in his house barking again. OK, got it. Yeah. Don't tell Tim Walls where your dog is. He'll do the hot swap. Nobody knows. Nobody knows who Scout really is. Who is Scout? No one knows. But what do you think, Danny? I think that that went about as poorly as it could have gone for Kamala Harris. And it was really interesting is for someone who makes such a fuss about how people pronounce her name. She called Dana Bash, Donna, Dina, Dina, whatever, like 20 different times. I'm like, there's no way this is real. She goes as far as calling people racist for mispronouncing her name. I'm like, I'm not going to make any allegations. But I mean, there's a case there for what Kamala Harris was saying to Dana Bash. Yeah, I think a really good point that really just this interview just drove home is that, you know, there's attack lines out there that Kamala is dangerously liberal. What it really is, is that she's dangerously fake. And so you can call it a flip flop. You can call it whatever it is. Really, she's lying just to advance her career. It's how she's gotten here in the first place, lying to us about Joe Biden's mental capacity, lying, lying to us about every single policy she holds, whether it's fracking or the border. And I think this interview really showed that she she's just a liar. She's a career liar. And you put her in office and man, better pray for this country, because I don't think we can recover from that level of deception. Bro, like, the thing I can't wrap my head around in any of this is that nobody, nobody is going to really like push her on the Joe Biden stuff. Like that's the biggest political scandal in American history, what they did to Joe. And she was in on the entire thing. She's Lady Macbeth. And yeah, and they push her and she's like, I was, I was making pancakes and that's it. And they were saying auntie this and auntie that like everything. Her entire DNC speech was this, you know, foghorn leghorn story of like her, like her family and where it came from. Like nobody cares about your mom. Nobody cares. Like the entire thing is autobiographical. Now people care about like, what's actually happening. We live in the real world, not some type of like, fake MTV crib, like like episode, crib episode about your life and your family, your home life. And Kamala Harris like did the same thing here. She like tried to, she tried to reduce the most savage and brutal political coup in American history into like some clap, happy family story, you know, with, with, with aunt Jemima syrup, except for you can't say aunt Jemima anymore. It's not that racist, Benny. They're bringing it back. That's why we got pancakes and our good friends that, you know, Oh, what's the name of our guy? That was really good. That was really sharp as attack there. Okay. Why don't you put your dog on? So Danny now, like, I don't know, like, I don't, I don't understand why no one's pushing more on this. And I hope that this is what Trump does in a debate, which I think he will destroy her in debate after watching this is so embarrassing, but like, why, why, why isn't Joe Biden running for president? Like this was supposed to be Joe Biden here. I hope that's Donald Trump's opening line. I think he absolutely will destroy Kamala Harris just on that line, line alone at a debate. But they asked her about this during the interview, and I've never seen anyone be more giddy about successfully completing a goo, a coup against her running mate and mentor than Kamala Harris. I mean, she looked like chuckles a clown up there on, on TV, like cackling about backstabbing her mentor, running mate, her sitting president. It's, it's a, it's a really, it's a really, it's a dark thing. And there's a lot of these focus groups out there where they'll go out and they'll ask average voters, what, like what holds you back, you know, when, when you're voting for Kamala Harris and they go, well, she lied to us about the president's, the sitting president's mental capabilities. And not only that, but she, I mean, right now she's, she's out there talking about what she would do differently. It's like, you're in power because we all know at this point, Joe Biden's not in charge. So if you're not in charge, who is, um, and that's kind of a scary point at this point is that like, she doesn't even know what her policies are. The one time she does get asked about her policies, she doesn't really know because they just, whatever's convenient at the time. Um, so I think, I think that that's the issue with Kamala is that she's just dangerously fake, um, whether it's lying about her ethnicity when she needs to, or pretending to be this and that. Um, I think, I think that's, I think that's what really makes people think twice about Kamala Harris is that she's, she's just fake. It was reflected perfectly. What you were just saying about Joe exiting is if we knew he was incapable, just completely out of his mind for the past three years, when I asked her, what have you done as vice president for three years? And she can't answer in a coherent manner. That's how, you know, she's lost before she's even started. And the fact that they're putting her up there, that's why they're running the basement campaign. She has nothing to run on. She sits there and wants to say that she's fixing climate change with the American Restoration Act. She doesn't even know how her policies line up. She can't give a coherent answer on foreign policy. And, you know, you look at this past week with the Kabul 13 families sitting there, the Biden administration still won't acknowledge them. They have lost all faith and respect, the military community, the American people, and a president who is just mentally incapacitated and a vice president who can't even articulate what she's done for three years. So I actually am. Please don't unsubscribe. I actually like I'm shocked that that Donna Dana, Dina Bash, don't misname her. I'm shocked that she asked tough questions. She did. You know, she like actually went there. She did. She she did. She she she went after Tim Walsall and Ballard, multiple lies that he said about IBF campaign trail, but swapping out his dog like everything like it's all like I can't believe she actually did it. And she went pretty hard in on Kamala. I mean, am I am I going soft? Like, obviously, there was plenty of fluff, but she actually did go in. The fluff was the CNN producers who were doing this cutaway segments to stretch out an 18 minute interview over the course of an hour long program. I went back and counted it just to make sure I had my numbers right. They did more than 20 minutes of cutaways and ads for an 18 minute interview to get this thing, this entire programming to an hour. So, I mean, were her questions tough? I think you're right on. Was there a lot of CNN fluff right surrounding every aspect of it? Absolutely. Yeah, I think that was probably one of the most powerful moments of the interview was her attacking or not attacking, just asking a very fair question to Tim Waltz. Hey, why did you lie about your military career? Like, why are you lying about your dog, dude? And then so he gets asked about his soul and valor, and then he automatically pivots to his dog. Listen, no one's like attacking your dog, dude. You're lying about your military career. And you have the you have the goal to like, just misrepresent, like going into combat when there's like, not to like, this was two days ago, we were celebrating the three year anniversary, not celebrating, but like honoring the three year anniversary of Joe Biden's botched with Afghanistan withdrawal. Kamala was in office for that. Joe Biden was on vacation didn't even bother to show up to the memorial service. Kamala was nowhere to be nowhere to be found. And like, Tim Walz is here lying about his military career. When we were like, just two days ago talking about 13 Americans who lost their lives defending this country in actual war. And so and frankly, lost their lives because of a botched Afghanistan withdrawal. That's you can squarely blame it on this administration. And so I think the pivot to the dog thing really bothered me because it's like, seriously, dude, that's where you're gonna go with this. Like, you're just the goal to do that while there's like, actual American soldiers that are that are losing their lives. And, you know, I think that's the contrast there is Trump's like, endless wars thing. And then Kamala is, you know, quite the opposite of that. And the goal of the left to go after Trump for wanting to go visit these families this week, when the Biden administration, which Kamala is the vice president for all these families have ever asked for, we've had them on the show, Benny, and we're gonna have some more on the show tomorrow. All they've ever asked for is just a call from the Biden-Harris administration. And they have not done that. So Kamala Harris owns it tonight. She didn't get it. She didn't get a single question about Afghanistan, the withdrawal or the deaths, suicidal deaths that the Biden administration pushed forward. She also didn't get a single question about any of her actual policies. What she was allowed to do was to endorse what's currently happening in this country. Bidenomics is a success. I maintain that when we do the work of bringing down prescription medication for the American people, including capping the cost of the annual cost of prescription medication for seniors at $2,000, when we do what we did in the first year of being in office to extend the child tax credit so that we cut child poverty in America by 50%, when we do what we have done to invest in the American people and bringing manufacturing back to the United States so that we created over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs, bringing business numbers back to America, what we have done to improve the supply chain, so we're not relying on foreign governments to supply American families with their basic needs. I'll say that that's good work. Oh, she says it's good work. Their economy is good work. Everything they've done. Like I counted like 17 different Trump campaign ads out of this interview. Kamala Harris didn't have to do this interview. She actually could have just like lived on the diabetic type two sugar high that the corporate media was like building her up into a mythic creature directly out of the Iliad. And doing this was a mistake. Doing this was a terrifying mistake, and probably one of the largest mistakes I've seen since Joe Biden did the debate. I can't even begin with what we just heard. The child tax credit, that was Trump who did that in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. And that's a J.D. Vance position as well, where he wants to actually increase it. So, you know, as you're saying, what are they? She's just literally taking everything that the Trump team has either created or says that they want to make better, and they're just grabbing onto it. I mean, like you said, it's a Trump ad almost. Donald Trump responding, saying, \"Boring.\" This was President Trump here saying this was a single word response. Boys, I think that Trump's going to, I think this is going to be a pretty, I mean, a single follow-up question to any of these, to any of these answers would have absolutely like blown the circuits for Kamala Harris and Tim Wall. All you need to do is like a simple follow-up. \"Hey, Tim, like here, here's a list. Here we go. I got a list for you. Here's a list of 150 different times that you call yourself a Command Sergeant Major, knowing full damn effing well that you're not a Command Sergeant Major.\" Now, 150 times is not a simple mistake. So why did you do that? Why did you lie? Like, that's all you need to do. That's a simple thing. There's no getting around that. You can't score, you can't get around that. And I pray JD does that. I just think that they're doomed. I think they're doomed. People are going to see this and they're going to be like horrified, actually. And Kamala Harris has lived, again, on this like little bubble, this teeny little totally fabricated bubble of media hype that exists only if she doesn't answer questions and say anything. And then when she starts, like as soon as she starts talking, like the entire, it all shatters. By the way, any self-respecting true journalist would have asked those follow-up questions, which I think is going to be Kamala's like major weakness come debate time is Trump's actually going to be prepared to push back on these asinine claims that she's making. And again, it just takes that simple question. You know, like the whole thing was, there was like that one Tim Walz question that was like slightly, you know, pressing. But the rest of it was all fluff. They're asking her about like, \"Oh, Trump accused you of this. What's your response?\" \"Oh, okay.\" Like clapping seals, like, \"Let's applaud for that.\" And then the weird thing is like they installed Kamala's emotional support VP beside her. And he was actually probably more of a liability than an asset. When you're looking at this interview, I mean, the guy was, I don't know what he was fiddling with bathroom products underneath the table or something, but he was totally out of it. And when they asked him any question, like it was, it just backfired. So. Dude, claiming that you falsely claimed that you went to war on multiple occasions, saying that's a grammar mistake. Do you realize you make that so much worse? You know, you're given a lot of opportunities. Like people have the capacity for forgiveness in this country. He's a Christian nation. So you're given the opportunity to just say like, \"I totally lied and that's wrong.\" And instead he called it a grammar mistake. Bro. Like that's not going to make this go away. It's dog. Yeah. Yeah. Not going to make this go away. This was a, this was very, this was very, very bad. Okay. So let's, let's, let's end here with the commentary from Tim Murtaugh, who was our guest tonight. After this interview, Harris is not going to want to do this again for a very long time. Kamala Harris, this is the Kamala Harris that the American emphatically rejected the last time she ran for president. It's not good. Boys, what do you think about coming up here in just a matter of days? Really? You can count down the hours. The Trump debate. I think that Donald Trump is going to have an opportunity to actually perform a true interview of Kamala Harris. And it's going to be, it's going to need an NC-17 rating, I think. I think it'll be career-ending. I think you just, Trump's going to have to just sit back and let Kamala be Kamala. She, let her barrier herself with her word salad. He's just got to go in for the zingers, go in for the kill and then just let her just sort of try to crawl her way back. And I think it's going to be fun to watch. Yeah, I think Trump's really going to have the opportunity. She'll be in the doghouse. Trump's really going to have the opportunity here to like embody that, like the Grim Reaper meme where it just goes door to door and just literally just end two Democratic general election campaigns in one cycle, which I think would make presidential history. So I think this debate's going to be the second go at his absolute clobbering of Joe Biden's campaign. And I think in a few days we're going to see that play out. I mean, it's very simple once you hit her on her disastrous record and the fact that she's dangerously fake. I mean, you hit her on those two points and I think it's her whole facade of her being brat pretty quickly falls apart. Talk about brat. Here's Donald Trump. Donald Trump dancing offstage, working a rope line, signing MAGA hats. This energy in Wisconsin, right? Where in Wisconsin is this? La Crosse, La Crosse. Okay. President Trump with a massive crowd. Concludes the clip. The contrast couldn't, frankly, be more harsh or more profound. Tulsi Gabbard also signing some MAGA hats, treated like a conquering hero. We love Tulsi, friend of the show. Ladies and gentlemen, that is a tough one. That's a tough night. Major takeaways here is Trump's going to destroy her in the debate. Major takeaway is that like this, this like that, that I think that I think that come election night, we're going to have we're going to have a result at about 9 p.m. Between nine and 10 p.m. There's no amount of propaganda that can solve for what's for what's happening here because the fundamentals are all wrong. And the fundamentals are wrong. And if you if you need a final and know the final clip is not going to be the final clip is not going to be Kamala here, but it's the people who are going on TV to professionally defend Kamala Harris can't even do it right now. CNN is melting down. We brought you CNN all night. CNN is melting down. None of their people can defend what's going on. This was on Fox News earlier. One hundred and forty million dollars raised. Eighty two million in one week. So when you talk about this, will you acknowledge that there's no policy page on her website? And so how do we know we should care about policy pages on websites when every single time since forever, every time she steps to the podium, she talks about her policy in such a direct way that voters are responding? Those are the people that policy is. Can you tell me what her border policy is? Oh, she she said on day one, she was signed the bipartisan border legislation that J.D. Vance and Donald Trump has taken credit for not getting across. What's your policy on fracking? She's going to introduce that her anonymous. So her interview tonight should give her the opportunity to share what she's got here. Interview tonight will give the opportunity. It's amazing. We have to pass it to find out what. Yes, that's right. Oh, man. Oh, boy. Yeah. Where do they find people? They're really, really good. Try that. Yeah. Try that. Try that, men. With your with your wives. Like, like, try it. Yeah. Hey, honey. Honey, where all the money in a bank account go? You know what? You're going to learn. You're going to learn eventually where it all went. OK. We're going to introduce it. It's going to be fun. It's going to be enjoyable. Yeah. The campaign's only 38 days old. They didn't have time to put the policies up yet. It's just too soon. Honey, what are we doing on Saturday night? We're going to you're going to know when we do it. What is wrong with you people? You're running a presidential campaign like it wouldn't be that would not be permissible if you're like a freshman in college, like dating like these answers are truly humiliating. Ladies and gentlemen, I got one final one final, very salty, very fun clip for you before we play our play, our exciting meme, which is Kamala Harris's husband who ended his first marriage because he banged the nanny and got her pregnant. That's a matter of fact. And then he and then he forced her to terminate the pregnancy, which is so such creepy, just awful behavior. But that's that's that's I mean, these are these are true things here that happened. His name is Doug Emhoff, and he was doing a rally today where he tried to get people to do a USA chant, USA chant. Now, boys, I just saw this clip in here. Where did it go? Did it get to get deleted? No, Doug Emhoff one. Doug Emhoff said trying to get trying to get the trying to get people to chant about USA, USA, USA. There we go. Okay, this is what we're up against. Ladies and gentlemen, Democrats trying to lead a USA chant. USA, USA. So you can say it. It was. It's his first time doing it. Give him a break. USA, USA. So you can say we're not allowed to say we're not allowed to be proud of our country. This is what we're up against, boys. We're going to win. We're going to win, boys. It's happening. All right. All right, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, Danny. Thank you, Robby, for being on the show. Thank you, Robby's Dog, for being on the show. We appreciate all of you. Much love. And thank you, Jerry, our illustrious me maker who created a meme that is currently going insanely viral right now and perfectly summed up this evening. As ever, the he who owns the memes owns the future. It's your boy Benny. You've been in the arena tonight. And now meme to take us away. It's ready for your interview. Actually, we'll be interviewing as a team. We want to tell you the stuff we're not good at our weaknesses. Yeah, I'm sorry. Who's this gentleman sitting behind you? Hello, Miss Lady. I'm Tim. I'm what you might call a workhorse. I need to have someone go up and down with me in the elevator. I have a weakness for sweet slow learners. We're not particularly good listeners. We're also slow learners. Okay, first of all, we - shut your mouth, shut shut your mouth. I'm speaking. We are gladiators. Step in the arena. Step in the arena. Gladiators in the Coliseum. Eyes on the prize. No surprise. We're here to get the schism. We're flexing the precision like a surgeon on a mission cutting through the noise slicing eagles and holding heads high. This show is a battlefield. It's hard and it's mean and the heart of the lion and the screams of your opponent. Don't lie. You enjoy it. We are gladiators in the arena. We are giants on the mountain. We are gladiators. We are gladiators. We are gladiators in the arena. We are giants on the mountain. We are gladiators. We are gladiators in the arena. We are gladiators in the arena. We are gladiators. We are gladiators. We are gladiators. We are gladiators in the arena.[BLANK_AUDIO]"

    "transcript": "[Music] In this world there's two kinds of people, my friend. Those with loaded guns and those who dig. [Music] Live from the Montana Wilderness Fortress, Wednesday nights at 9 Eastern, this is the Matt Christensen Hour. [Music] Hello and welcome to the show. My name is Matt Christensen. This is the Matt Christensen Hour on Tenet Media. Thank you for tuning in. I'm joined, as always, by my producer down under, Tim. Good day, Tim. G'day. I hope everyone in the audience is having an awesome week. I hope you're having a good week, Matt. And by the way, happy birthday to Calvin for Monday, I think. Good memory. My oldest son's birthday, his third birthday, is Labor Day Monday. Right. Appreciate that on behalf of my family. No guests tonight, but no shortage of news to discuss either. So that's no problem. Among the items for discussion this evening, Mark Zuckerberg admits in a letter to Congress that, yes, the Biden administration routinely pressured his company to censor posts about COVID they didn't like. The direct connection between the White House and social media censorship that the Supreme Court majority recently said could not be reliably established continues to be well established. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris agrees to an interview. She's finally going to do one on the lamest, most cowardly terms possible. With her VP pick, Tim Walz, by her side. She won't even do it alone. She's got to have a partner. And only pre-taped, we're not going to do it live, and only on CNN with Dana or Dana Bash. I still am unclear. Is it Dana or Dana? Do we have an official word on that, Tim? I've always heard of Dana from memory. I don't know. Maybe it is Dana. Everyone's saying Dana now. So I'm going to go with Dana. I mean, we do have that whole nonsense of fanny, phony. I'm not calling it phony. I don't care. But we do have that, so I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I forgot about that. Anyway, CNN is where it's going to happen. I had heard it reported that it was going to be NBC, but I guess not. Now CNN was the winning bidder, apparently. Still, despite all the nonsense, I very much look forward to viewing this tomorrow night. It'll be taped tomorrow and available for viewing tomorrow night. So we'll see how that goes. Plus, there are updates in the Trump criminal prosecutions. And I'll take an email question about voting restrictions before we're out of here for the evening. We'll catch up on your super chats on YouTube and Rumble as well. And remember, the show is not only available by video on YouTube, Rumble, and X. And my sources say the stream is back on all those platforms this evening. But hey, there are audio feeds of the show too, wherever you prefer to listen to your podcasts, you can find this show. To find those feeds, check out the podcast page of my website, mattchristensenmedia.com/podcast. And of course, thanks as always to Tenet Media for hosting the show. Follow them on X at WatchTenetNow and Instagram at WatchTenet for more great original content, breaking news, and viral videos. A few items of housekeeping before we get into that news as I mentioned, I believe the stream is good to go everywhere. My apology for technical difficulties last week where we were only live on YouTube. We should be back on all platforms now. And hopefully, the problem with the third party that manages sending the stream to all the places it goes is now resolved. But as always, if you encounter any technical problems, please let me know. We want to bring you the show where you're looking to find it. We've also had some difficulty with Rumble Rants in recent weeks and the ability to read them. Now that we're back on Rumble Live, if you would like to send a message and support the show through Rumble Rants, those are good to be read as well. So you can super chat over on Rumble with confidence. And finally, remember next week is the first show of the month, September already. We're entering the home stretch. My friend Frank from Quite Frankly will be here for his monthly appearance to break down all things in the news. Should be a good time as always. Look forward to that next week. Meanwhile, in the news, as I mentioned, Mark Zuckerberg, who has been involved in ongoing congressional investigations into White House pressure on social media companies to censor content they don't like. Mark Zuckerberg, of course, CEO of Meta, which is the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, providing yet more evidence or at least evidence in the form of his own testimony that, yeah, that was going on a lot. Not even here and there. A lot from from the White House sending us messages, exerting pressure on us to censor posts, particularly about covid that they didn't like. And we knew that this was going on back from the start of the administration. You had then Press Secretary Jen Psaki taking the White House podium early in the Biden White House and saying, yeah, we are flagging posts for Facebook to remove. And a few people asked, what do you mean you are the federal government, you are the executive branch of the federal government. What are you talking about flagging posts to be removed? That seems to have some First Amendment implications. And at the time it was don't be a conspiracy theorist. Of course, of course, they're not directly censoring Americans. Well, then, of course, we had the entire lawsuit from state attorneys general and other parties who were censored on behalf of the White House. Discovery in that case showed that not only was there pressure exerted from the White House to the social media companies to censor opinions they didn't like. There were direct communication portals between the White House and social media companies where the White House personnel or other people within the executive branch and the federal government, the FBI as well, could send messages to Metta, Twitter, others. Hey, I saw this post on there. We don't like that. Please remove it. And then the social media companies would remove the content on behalf of the federal government. And so in that context, you now have Mark Zuckerberg sending a letter to the Congressional Oversight Committee. Saying, yeah, the White House pressured us to censor a lot, and some of it, some of it we did, and I kind of regret that. The letter reads in part. In 2021, senior officials from the Biden administration repeatedly pressured our teams for months to censor certain COVID-19 content, including humor and satire. That joke will not be allowed. And expressed a lot of frustration with our teams when we didn't agree. So what's key there? Repeatedly pressured for months. This was not just like a guy saying, hey, I don't like that post or I disagree with this or I disagree with that. This was an ongoing, active campaign with dedicated attention. The letter continues, I believe the government pressure was wrong, and I regret that we were not more outspoken about it. I also think we made some choices that with the benefit of hindsight and new information we would not make today. The fact that he knew the government pressure was wrong and didn't say anything about it is explained by one of two things or both. Number one, Zuck maybe liked the government's opinion about the censorship. He likes taking down the posts on behalf of their opinion. And he went along with it because they're friendly on those terms. Or number two, Zuck feared punishment for noncompliance. And if, too, the fear of punishment has any truth to it at all, well, it completely contradicts what would seem to be a mitigating point in this letter. Zuck writes, ultimately, it was our decision whether or not to take content down, and we own our decisions. But what if those decisions are influenced by someone who has no legitimate role in that influence or in that decision? As in the federal government on speech. See Amendment 1. And what we're talking about here is the difference between the government actually pointing the gun at someone and saying, \"You will not say that. You will not be allowed to say that. We will punish you if you do.\" That direct form of censorship. Or even pointing the gun at Facebook in a very obvious, overt way and saying, \"You will take that down on our behalf.\" Or federal government agents just using the implicit threat of their activity, their action, their punishment for that sort of perspective. And saying, \"Man, it'd be a real shame if that post stayed up. It'd be a real shame if people continued expressing this particular opinion we don't like.\" That's kind of the point. As we'll get to with the Supreme Court decision in a moment from earlier this summer when they say, \"Well, we couldn't establish the direct evidence.\" Yeah, but that's really the idea. The government's not going to go to these people and say, \"You will do this or else.\" They're just going to use that implied threat of the force of the federal government to get people to act on their behalf. And that appears to be what happened here. Zuck writes additionally, \"Zuck bucks are dead for 2024.\" He actually does talk about the FBI warning Facebook about the Hunter Biden laptop story, which I want to get to in a moment. So he discusses that a little bit more. He also says, \"The Zuck bucks from 2020, they're over. They're not coming back in 2024.\" If you recall in 2020, Mark Zuckerberg used charitable money or money through his charitable foundation to donate to local election offices to help them facilitate elections through the difficulties of the pandemic. And he says that because that was at least perceived to have partisan effects, he's not going to do that again this time because he doesn't want that perception of having partisan loyalties. Now, of course, what Zuckerberg is saying there closely corresponds with what he already said to Joe Rogan in 2022. And on Joe Rogan's show back then, he described the FBI coming to Facebook right before the 2020 election and warning them that the Hunter Biden laptop story was Russian disinformation, at least implicitly, and that Russian disinformation ought to be tightly controlled. The FBI, I think, basically came to us, some folks on our team, and was like, \"Hey, just so you know, you should be on high alert. We thought there was a lot of Russian propaganda in the 2016 election. We have it on notice that basically there's about to be some kind of dump that's similar to that. So just be vigilant.\" What Twitter did is they said, \"You can't share this at all.\" We didn't do that. If something is reported to us as potentially misinformation, important misinformation, we also have this third-party fact-checking program because we don't want to be deciding what's true and false. And for the, I think it was five or seven days when it was basically being determined whether it was false, the distribution on Facebook was decreased. Fewer people saw it than would have otherwise. So it definitely \u2013 By what percentage? I don't know off the top of my head, but it's meaningful. We just kind of thought, \"Hey, look, if the FBI, which I still view as a legitimate institution in this country, it's a very professional law enforcement, they come to us and tell us that we need to be on guard about something, then I want to take that seriously.\" Yeah, that's your problem, viewing the FBI as a legitimate institution and very professional law enforcement. I wonder if Mark Zuckerberg is having any kind of change of heart on that or not. Of course, we would later find out that the laptop that the FBI was warning about was 100% authentic, not just according to reporting in the New York Post, according to the FBI themselves, because they testified to the authenticity at the trial of Hunter Biden for his gun paperwork crimes earlier this year and last. And funny, the FBI got a particular outcome out of that strategy, if you want to call it that, cynically, I suppose. Suppressing that information led to what? An electoral advantage for Joe Biden. Joe Biden gets into the White House, and guess what? The executive branch censorship effort goes into overdrive. So connect all these dots and it would appear that there is an organized effort to censor by any other means or censor through indirect third-party methods in exactly the way that the lawsuit that went to the Supreme Court was alleging. Now, the White House has responded. They released a statement after Zuckerberg's letter was published. The statement reads, \"When confronted with a deadly pandemic, this administration encouraged responsible actions to protect public health and safety. Our position has been clear and consistent. We believe tech companies and other private actors should take into account the effects of their actions or the effects that their actions have on the American people while making independent choices about the information they present.\" So no denial there, which means confirmation of the core of what Zuckerberg is saying, that they were in frequent communication with Zuckerberg's companies to take down this information or that information. They're just saying, \"Oh, no, no. It wasn't compulsory. We weren't coercing. We were just suggesting.\" But who actually needs to consider the consequences of their actions here? It's the federal government, not just because they are conveniently avoiding the limitations of the First Amendment in a way that renders it next to meaningless, but because there are consequences to them deciding what information is legitimate and what information is not. The information that they went after, the FBI, the White House, was crucial in the last election, deciding who would be the President of the United States. You have that. True information was hidden from the American voter. Information on COVID that was supposedly conspiracy theories or misinformation, a lot of that turned out to be true. If you actually listened to the posts that the White House had deleted on their behalf, instead of the CDC, you probably lived a healthier life. You probably chugged horse paste and you went to the gym, and you're a lot stronger and healthier for it. So the idea that the federal government saved a bunch of lives with their information control through COVID, I don't think that there's a lot of evidence to say that's the case at all. Even if it is the case, it's not up to the federal government to determine what is true and what is false. That's the whole point of the First Amendment. It is up to the free exchange of ideas, and it is up to the mind of the American citizen. And as a result of that debate that the federal government is not supposed to be a participant in that way, or at least controlling that debate. Now, the lawsuit I mentioned from the state attorneys general and other parties who were at least indirectly censored at the government's pressure, that, of course, got to the Supreme Court. We discussed it when the decision came out earlier this summer. And the Supreme Court decided very disappointingly that they weren't even going to get to the merits of the case. That is to say, what are the limitations of the federal government's ability to make suggestions to third parties to take action that the federal government is otherwise prohibited from taking itself, like censoring certain viewpoints. The Supreme Court didn't even get to that because they ruled that the parties who brought the lawsuit didn't have standing. They didn't have a legal basis to sue the federal government. Why? Well, primarily because the Supreme Court majority, in an opinion written by Amy Coney Barrett, because there was not a sufficient connection or a direct connection to say that it was the White House who censored these people. That it was plausible that these social media companies just censored them on their own behalf. And even though they had conversations with the White House, there's nothing wrong with people talking to each other. There's not enough evidence to say that it was because of White House pressure that these censorship actions were taken. And part of that reasoning was there was no evidence to say that it was ongoing. And Amy Coney Barrett here is talking about ongoing into the future rather than something limited to the past of, say, the pandemic itself. Now, in fairness to Amy Coney Barrett, obviously she wasn't looking at the evidence we've just received from Mark Zuckerberg in the form of his testimony. And so I have to qualify her writing and her decision with that. Although, of course, I disagree with her finding here because I think it was sufficiently demonstrated that these people were censored on behalf of the White House. But, of course, the testimony from Mark Zuckerberg now in the form of this letter adds a lot of evidence to that. If we're saying there's no evidence of direct censorship influence and it's not ongoing, here's Mark Zuckerberg with the letter saying both of those things. Oh yeah, they were definitely pressuring us to take down content. They expressed disapproval to us when we didn't do it. And they had they did this over a long period of time. It wasn't limited to like, hey, I saw that one post and I didn't really like it. What do you think about that? This was an organized campaign. And the problem that the Supreme Court decision creates, again, didn't get to the First Amendment merits. But the question of who can bring a lawsuit if if the government resorts to this kind of sneaky third party way of doing things that otherwise can't do itself. How does anyone get any kind of resolution against that through the courts? If you if you have to show rock solid proof, like some sort of communication between the federal government and this third party saying you must do this censorship or we will punish you with X, Y and Z. As I said, that's kind of the point. The whole point of the scheme is that there isn't that. That it's kind of this wink, wink, nudge, nudge, either they're very friendly and so they do it on behalf of the government in that way, or it's just the implied threat of the force of the federal government. And as anybody knows, if FBI agents come knocking on your door, that's not like a hang out and drink a beer type scenario that has an implied threat of force to it. You're nervous in that situation for a reason. So we have this kind of open ended area of of anti First Amendment censorship that as of now, nobody can even challenge. We'll see if the if the plaintiffs can get that cleaned up, because even though this particular case was dismissed by the Supreme Court on the standing grounds, it doesn't mean it's dead. One of the parties to the suit was Attorney General Andrew Bailey of Missouri, and he said after the decision came out in June, we're going right back to the district court to try to obtain more materials and discovery. And we will bring this back to established standing. So it's not dead. Just means that I guess there's more investigation necessary. But if the Supreme Court's standard is you have to show something more direct than what we already know, which is Mark Zuckerberg saying there's a direct censorship campaign, direct communication portals for the purpose of censorship. If you need something more direct, like take that down or I'll shoot you in the face. I don't know. This is a very difficult standard that the Supreme Court is establishing. And if we don't get this cleaned up, it just means that the federal government can use third party private actors to do all sorts of things on behalf of the federal government that the federal government can't do itself. So this is one area of First Amendment case law that hopefully gets addressed. Maybe this case will be the one to do it once they, I guess, get more evidence. But that's where that stands. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris's first interview is set. It is officially happening this coming more than a month after becoming the de facto and then, of course, now the official nominee for the Democratic Party for president. Kamala Harris has scheduled her first interview. As I mentioned, it won't be by herself. It won't be live and it definitely won't be adversarial. It will be prerecorded tomorrow with CNN's Dana Bash. And it will air for everyone to view tomorrow night at nine Eastern. Unclear how long the interview is going to be unclear, how edited it will be, but you can bet there will be cuts. That is the point of not doing it live. And of course, it's not just Kamala Harris who has been avoiding the press, avoiding the interviews. Tim Walz, the vice presidential nominee, has not done interviews either. That is clearly a deliberate choice of the campaign as well. And the reason they're going to get into this interview together or do this together is the same reason you separate witnesses when you're investigating a crime or you're really investigating anything. You can't lie together when you're separated and contradictions matter. So that's why they're going to have Walz and Kamala in there together is so they can get their story straight. If you talk to them separately, one might say A and the other says B and you have a contradiction to resolve. And to that point, it's not just the entire country that doesn't know what Kamala's policy positions actually are. Because she doesn't explain them, maybe she will tomorrow. It is also Tim Walz. Politico Playbook reads this week, \"What about Tim?\" As in, why won't Tim Walz do an interview either? One of the issues that Harrisworld is currently working to address is how to deploy running mate Tim Walz to the media. The danger with sending him out to do big solo interviews is that he might not have a full command of where Harris is on every issue. As someone pointed out last night, Harris talks about an opportunity economy. But what if Walz were asked to define it? Would he know? As though Kamala Harris knows what an opportunity economy is. There is no definition. That's the point. It just sounds good. It feels good. Ooh, an opportunity economy. As opposed to what? A suffering economy? The problem is she and Joe Biden have created a suffering economy over the last four years. And she's been personally a part of that too, by ramming through massive government spending that of course caused a lot of this inflation with her tie-breaking vote in the Senate. So, that's why Tim Walz hasn't been talking. That's why they're going to talk together. So they can try to figure it out with the help of each other. And so they don't get caught in any contradictions or lies. Or at least as few as possible. But let's take a trip down Dana Bash memory lane. Because of course this was effectively an interview awarded to the highest bidder. And I'm not talking about bids in terms of currency, money. I'm talking about bids in terms of what the Kamala Harris campaign thinks that particular interviewer or that particular network offers to Kamala Harris. Because remember every journalist, every reporter in the country wants this interview. It only went to Dana Bash. Why did it only go to Dana Bash? Well, we can take a tour through some of her recent commentary to evaluate how that might play into the interview. Here is Dana Bash just last week insisting that Donald Trump is actually responsible for the botched Afghanistan withdrawal because the Trump administration actually negotiated the agreement with the Taliban. As you well know, the Trump administration negotiated the withdrawal agreement from Afghanistan with the Taliban and the State Department. A conditional agreement. And he left Bagram Air Base. He left 2,500 troops. His advisers came to him and said the Taliban haven't lived up to it. And he said, fine, deal's off. So actually the botched withdrawal was Trump's fault because Trump tied the hands of Biden with a previously negotiated deal with the Taliban. That would be the point there. Now, did the Trump administration negotiate the Afghanistan withdrawal? Yes. Generally speaking, they did. Does that absolve Joe Biden from responsibility for the execution of that withdrawal eight months into his presidency? No, it does not. Not just because the commander in chief can adjust military strategy at his command. That's part of the job. But because the government or because the agreement rather gave him an escape that he didn't use. If Biden was convinced that the withdrawal was so unwise that we weren't ready to do this and it was too hurried and we had to take more time, he could have done that. He had a not just as he as president, can he adjust on the fly if he has to, but under the actual agreement itself, he could make changes. Because the agreement with the Taliban had an escape clause. If peace talks with the Afghan government failed, they did fail. And Biden already delayed the withdrawal for this agreement from May to September. That was his decision to make. How did he make that change if Trump had tied him up? Why was the withdrawal done the way that it was done? What what was the nature of the September date? Well, it was the 20th anniversary of September 11th. Joe Biden wanted the victory lap of having Afghanistan done by the 20 year anniversary. And so he just hustled out of there. Of course, it cost 13 American lives. We left billions in equipment behind. The Taliban has taken the country over again, all of that, so he could have a victory lap that he never took because the whole thing was a disaster. That's but but the Dana Bash characterization of the events, Trump did it all. Joe Biden was just following Trump's instructions. OK. Then we have Dana Bash asking or saying that saying that Joe Biden. Asking why Trump. Didn't release the Russian hostages like Joe Biden did at the start of the month, we had that hostage exchange deal or a prisoner exchange deal with with Russia. Joe Biden came out and said, well, if Trump thought he could do better, why didn't he get them released when when he was president? And Dana Bash adoringly called that a mic drop moment. President Trump has said repeatedly that he could have gotten the hostages out without giving anything in exchange. What do you say to that? What do you say to President Trump now, former president? Why didn't you do this, president? I think that was what they call a mic drop moment at the end there. Why didn't you do it when he was president? What a historic moment. Yeah, except for that is completely nonsensical. The reason that Donald Trump did not get those prisoners released when he was president is because they were not prisoners when he was president, except for one. There's maybe a nugget of truth to that statement, but three out of the four were not even in prison in Russia at the time. We had the four people, the four people who were secured as a result of the deal. You had Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, Marine vet Paul Whelan, Russian-American journalist also Kermysheva and Vladimir Kara Mirza, a Russian-British political activist. The one of those four who was actually in Russian prison during Trump's term was Paul Whelan. But the others were arrested in 2022 and 2023. So the answer for why Trump didn't get these people released when he was president is because they were not in prison when Trump was president. But speaking of the question, why didn't you do it when you were president or maybe vice president? Great question for Dana Bash to ask Kamala Harris tomorrow. Great mic drop moments all around if she deploys that question. I hear a lot of lofty promises from you, Kamala Harris. Why didn't you do these things during your term as vice president or when you were in the Senate? I look forward to hearing the answers. One more. Here is Dana Bash in February when the Supreme Court said, no, the 14th Amendment does not require Donald Trump to be kicked off the ballot because of some kooky reading of section three of that amendment. And she said, unfortunately for America, the Supreme Court got the legal issue right. Look, unfortunately for America, the court isn't necessarily wrong that this is the way the framers wanted it to be. They wanted Congress, the people who are closest to their constituents, to be able to make the rules of the laws. Yes, unfortunately for America, we have rule of law and voters making decisions. Well, the court isn't necessarily wrong. In other words, the court is 100 percent correct on the legal issue. And you know that. Why? Because the Supreme Court made the decision unanimously. It was 9-0. No, the 14th Amendment does not mean states must kick candidates that Democrats don't like off the ballot. Even the looniest on the court, Sotomayor, Kagan, Jackson, even they had no argument in support of this nonsense, which would absolutely remove power from the people. So what exactly is unfortunate when Dana Bash says that? What is unfortunate? Is it unfortunate that the Supreme Court followed the law and didn't abuse their power to eliminate a candidate that particular people don't like? Is that unfortunate that we had rule of law in that scenario? Is it unfortunate, as she implied there, that Congress has authority in this matter? Remember, that was the Supreme Court decision that enforcing Section 3, this insurrectionist clause, or the insurrection clause as they call it, that determining who is and is not an insurrectionist or determining who is and is not qualified is left up to Congress. It's not just for like that crazy Secretary of State in Colorado or some other random person to decide on a whim. Is that unfortunate that Congress, representing the people, has authority on this matter? What's unfortunate about that? Or is it just unfortunate because it benefits the candidate that Dana Bash doesn't like? And if that's the case, if that's what she means by unfortunate, \"Oh, it works to the benefit of the guy I don't like,\" how are we supposed to have any faith in this interview coming up tomorrow? What if Dana Bash thinks Kamala Harris looking dumb is unfortunate? Unfortunate for the country? Is she going to put her own views on the scale? Are they going to edit the interview to make her look better so that it's more fortunate for her political preferences? I'm not trying to be so cynical here. I wish I could hear her explain to me what she means when she says, \"The court got the legal matter right, unfortunately for America.\" Elaborate. Because if you just mean, \"I hate Trump,\" how am I supposed to put any sort of faith in your objectivity in this interview that's coming up tomorrow? Though, of course, people would say, \"You don't need to use so many words to say CNN sucks,\" I suppose. This is just an overcomplicated analysis of what we already knew to be true. CNN was selected for a reason. I think the reason that CNN was selected is because the Kamala Harris campaign wants a network that is friendly enough not to be a threat to them, but not so friendly that it looks like outright propaganda, at least some kind of perception of objectivity. That's why I'm guessing that CNN was the pick. It's friendly enough that they know they're going to come out looking decent, if she has the sort of interview that some of her commentary there would suggest. But it's not, say, MSNBC or something like that, where critics could say it's outright partisan propaganda. Now, I do think it's outright partisan propaganda, probably, but I'm saying they want some plausible deniability for that accusation. And one thing, I haven't seen any claims to the contrary, but I have to wonder, especially in the context of a prerecorded, not live interview, is it possible that Kamala Harris is going to have the questions ahead of time? I haven't seen any commentary to say yes or no from CNN or the Kamala Harris campaign. And I would like to think that journalistic integrity would compel CNN not to do that. However, it is CNN, and we're talking about the same network that just put up the clips, the same reporter that just created the clips that I just played. Is it possible that Kamala Harris is going to have prerecorded answers to this prerecorded interview, like rehearsed answers? She knows she even there will be a scripted challenge to her, like, oh, how do you explain this? It looks like a gotcha question, but she actually had it ahead of time to prepare an answer. Again, I'm not I'm not saying I have evidence to suggest they're doing that. I just wonder, given how tightly controlled this is, if that's a possibility that this whole thing is is actually scripted or that there's a lot of information exchanged ahead of time. And if that was part of the reason why CNN and Dana Bash were selected, what was offered? I saw reports earlier in the week and I try to track them down, but then I couldn't find them. So maybe I was mistaken, but I thought the Kamala Harris campaign had said that they were going to do an interview with a yet to be determined NBC reporter. Now it's CNN and Dana Bash. What changed or am I just mistaken in seeing that report? I don't know. But again, given that every reporter, every network in the country wants this interview, you have to wonder what terms were offered to secure this interview for CNN and Dana Bash. And Tim, you had mentioned that you saw a report from Politico that that the Kamala Harris campaign was just running around saying, hey, guys, our friends in our friends in the newsrooms, who should we talk to? Yes, and not only did the article basically say that, that she was asking advice of journalists of who to talk to, which is an insane way to do things. But the other insane way to do it was apparently media outlets were pitching to her what it was like the bachelor. Do it. This is why you should pick me. I guarantee you that stuff was going on. Yeah, that's not how the media is supposed to work. If you literally have to pitch to the presidential candidate from the Democrats that she needs to come talk on your show, then I'm sorry, you've lost the battle already. We should all be insulted by that. Every voter, regardless of ideology, should be insulted by that. Of course, I have my own ideological priors and I'll defend them. But that doesn't mean I don't expect candidates who agree with me to face reporters and answer to the American people. If you are trying to gain and exercise power over the American people, you owe it to them to explain the philosophy by which you'll operate and how you'll exercise that power. And a refusal to do that or making it into a game where only certain people are going to have access to that information, it should be insulting to every voter, regardless of your ideology. You should be personally insulted by that. And I would hold that rule to be just as true for candidates I agree with as I would for candidates like Kamala Harris, who I can't stand. The propaganda, I love to read comment sections on stuff like that on Twitter and Facebook. And the explanation I've seen from the Kamala diehards is, \"Oh, no, no, there's nothing shady going on here. The campaign is so hurried and it's such a short timeline that they need time to organize. They actually don't know what their agenda is. They don't know what their platform is. They're designing it right now. And then once it comes together, then they'll be speaking with the press.\" Yeah, I notice it's taken weeks and weeks to just give me a basic understanding of your policy preferences on the most basic issues. Meanwhile, I'm looking at the clock and people start voting in some states in just a few weeks time. So it would appear that there's an effort to run out the clock, to just not discuss what your ideas are, bank on the selling point that you are not Trump, and expect to cash in on that selling point electorally in the coming weeks when people start voting before they actually have a chance to learn anything about the campaign. This is really slimy stuff that's going on. But you know, the way things are going, I really wish that Kamala would have agreed to do her interview on CNBC. Because the interviews with Kamala representatives on CNBC recently, highly entertaining. I want to see the candidate herself on these shows. And it's actually just Squawk Box. This is not a show that I watch regularly, but of course CNBC is a financial news type network and that's what Squawk Box covers. And this morning CNBC's Squawk Box, they hosted Kamala campaign representative Bharat Rama. Almost looks like Borat his name, but it's not. It's Bharat, not Borat. They host this guy to discuss Kamala Harris' plan to tax unrealized gains. And for those who haven't heard, Kamala's at least partly explained tax plan, there's a whole article in the New York Times recently. What is it? What we know about Kamala Harris' $5 trillion tax plan so far. Again, where are the specifics? We have to piece it together like it's a puzzle. A guy said this in a tweet, and an anonymous source from the campaign said this to that outlet. Well, the New York Times reports that we have a plan to tax unrealized gains. But don't worry, it's only for really rich people. Taxing people with over $100 million in wealth, 25% on unrealized gains. So, how does this play out? You're a very, very rich guy. You buy a share of a particular stock for $20. This year the value of that share increases to $25. You just hold it, you didn't do anything with it, you just bought a share of that stock, it's $20 when you bought it. Now you look at the value of that share on the market, it's $25. Hey, that's great. Even though you didn't sell it though, the feds are going to start taxing you on that $5. You never realized the gain, because you never sold that share, but the feds are still going to tax you on it. And it makes no sense. It's kind of like a sales tax on a product that you haven't even bought yet, that you might buy in the future. It is a tax on a possible, but not yet real, transaction. And yet to be explained, do you get credit when the value of the assets declines? Like, oh, I bought a share of a stock for $100 last year, but the company taxed, and now it's only worth $20. Do I get a tax credit for the loss? That's not explained yet. I'm guessing no. No, you only get taxed on the unrealized gains, not the unrealized, you don't get benefits for the unrealized losses. And so the CNBC host challenged the Kamala campaign representative on this plan, and he insisted, oh no, no, this is just like property tax. Taxing unrealized gains just doesn't seem fair in any sense of the word. Can I make a quick point on that? In the very best sense, if you are taxing unrealized gains, all you're doing is pulling forward the taxes that would be paid later when someone actually sells the stock. I think that this reaction to unrealized gains is a little funny, given that I bet that the majority of people watching right now are already paying a tax on unrealized gains. It's called a property tax. Property tax. When the value of your home goes up, you pay higher taxes, even if you don't sell your home. Your value of your home never moves the way a stock moves, the way something else moves. That's always the go-to answer. It's also property tax is a use tax. You're paying for the schools. You're paying for emergency services. Those are things that make absolute sense. And sure, and all the revenue that comes in from these unrealized gains taxes and the other taxes in the Harris plan are going to go to creating what she calls more opportunity. It's to make sure that every newborn born in this country gets $6,000. But it's not a use tax for the people who are actually using the services. You're arguing that this is some sort of foreign concept that's completely unknown in the U.S. tax code. It's probably unconstitutional. And it was never in anyone's intent to tax. It's not an income tax. And it's never going to happen. Absolutely idiotic argument, as the hosts explain. Number one, even if the property tax comparison is valid, which it isn't for the reasons that they identified, why would accepting property tax on my home mean I must accept additional property tax? Oh, you get taxed on the value of your home. So you must be fine with a property tax on your car. No, I'm not, actually. We have plenty of taxes already. I don't want more. Even if I accept, let's say that I accept the legitimacy of sales tax in my state as a method of raising revenue, necessary revenue for the state. OK, nobody likes taxes, but maybe they're a necessary evil of some form to fund government X, Y, and Z. And you accept the legitimacy of sales tax in your state. Does that mean that you'd be fine with raising sales tax to 50%, 75%? Does it mean you'd be fine with expanding sales tax from item A to item B? No, there isn't. We should aim to minimize taxes. Just because I accept it in one arena doesn't mean I accept it in another. Nobody wants more property tax, federal property tax in this case. And that's the second point. At least property taxes that he's talking about, those are local and therefore more accountable. When I pay property tax on my home or you pay it on your home, it's funding the schools. It's funding other services in my county and in my state. And if my county or my state goes crazy in taxing property, number one, the people who are responsible for that, the voters in my community or the politicians who are behind it, they're more accessible. I can go bang on their door much more easily. Or if they're unworkable, guess what I can do? I can move to another state that is more reasonable with its tax rates and doesn't punish property owners in that way. When the federal government does this, there is no escaping. They have their tentacles in everything with little accountability. And as the host said there, this is very likely unconstitutional. When he says \u2013 the guy says, \"Oh, you're acting like this is never heard of.\" This is unheard of for the federal government. The federal government has income tax through the 16th Amendment. It has constitutional authority, Congress does, for income tax through the 16th Amendment to the Constitution. What does that say? Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes on incomes. Unrealized capital gains are not income. You buy an asset. You hang on to that asset. The value of that asset appreciates. That is not income unless and until you sell the asset. Therefore, even if Congress were to pass such a law, which they won't, this whole thing is almost certainly unconstitutional. It wouldn't survive legal challenge on that basis. And you've got to think of just how idiotic this whole thing is. He says at the end there, \"Well, we're just taken from really rich people so that we can give a $6,000 credit to families of more modest means when they have a child.\" How about just stop taking everyone's money instead of federal government redistributing wealth in this way? How about just leave the wealthy investors alone and leave the family with the newborn alone? How about that? How about not discouraging investment in this way? If you want awesome new things to be developed and if you want wealth to grow, you need investment encouraged, not discouraged. And if by investing wisely, which that's what \u2013 if you invest wisely, you buy an asset and it appreciates in value, the federal government then punishes you and you have a financial liability. Because you've invested wisely, that does what? It discourages investment. Because if you're a good investor and you're making gains on your investment, it means what? You will have to cover the new tax liability that the federal government has imposed on you and how do you do that? You either hang on to cash to cover that cost or you sell assets. Either way, it's less money invested. It's more money to the redistribution of the federal government. And for people who would say, oh, it's just for the people with the $100 million in wealth, whatever. How do you think they got to the $100 million in wealth? By investing wisely. If you discourage the investment, the wealth won't grow. And guess what a great way to reduce the wealth of \u2013 to reduce overall wealth is? Discouraging investment in this way. If you do this, if you go after people with $100 million in wealth, okay, great. Now once you've punished them sufficiently that there aren't people of that level of wealth anymore, who are you going to go after after that? You're going to run out of people of \u2013 with sufficient wealth to tax if you take this approach. So good luck when you run a platform of taking from rich people to provide for those of more modest means. You're going to run out of rich people from whom to take very quickly. Then you have \u2013 that segment actually followed a similar segment with Elizabeth Warren appearing on the same show last week. Elizabeth Warren was asked about this genius plan to go after the supposed price gougers in the food industry as though that's what caused inflation, of course. Not government restricting supply with COVID lockdown nonsense and boosting demand with all the free money for everybody. Just like the first guy there, Borat or Barat or whatever his name was. The first guy said taxing unrealized gains is the same as property tax. Elizabeth Warren says price controls, that's just \u2013 that's actually the norm. All the states are doing that. Look at the Washington Post, and if you lose the Washington Post as a Democrat, you've got some serious problems. I can paint you a picture of how that would work and how it's worked in the past where we've tried to artificially hold prices down. Competition doesn't come in. People don't \u2013 like if beef is too high, people don't move the chicken. The competitors don't come in to undercut where the beef prices are. Nothing works when you try to artificially control prices. It's just a supply and demand issue. It's a flawed idea. I understand if you want to do a lecture about this, but let's just start with where have you been for the last 30 years as three dozen states have price gouging laws and they have used them effectively? Sometimes markets go off the rails, and when they do, we need some ways to get them back on the rails. We need some curbs on that behavior. What did you say was 440 percent profit increase? The example you used, the prior quarter from the year before, they had a charge of $1.3 billion, an accounting change which wiped out profits. Then they earned what they normally \u2013 let me finish now. They earned \u2013 You didn't let me finish. Look at the data. Come on. We have economic study now after economic study. This is the way it always goes. This is the way you never lose an argument because no one can ever say anything back to you, Senator. The state price gouging laws. The entire premise, of course, has never made any sense. Kamala said the same thing during her speech announcing the plan, and this was part of what Elizabeth Warren said. Oh, it's the price gouging. We understand most businesses are honest, but a select few of them jack up prices. So we're just going after the select few. How are prices up for the entire economy then? If it's just a select few dishonest business actors who are price gouging, why are prices up everywhere consistently? Why aren't prices only high at the dishonest abuser grocery store? How are a few bad actors exercising control over the entire American economy? Unexplained. As far as having price gouging laws, where have you been? That's the norm. Price gouging laws are stupid. Price gouging is just a term to describe the surge in demand for a particular good. Way more people want that good now than usual, and so people are willing to pay way more for that good now than usual. When you set an artificial ceiling for what a price is or for what a seller can provide that service or good for, you discourage that supplier from bringing that good or service to market. And if you discourage suppliers from bringing the good or service to market, you have a drop in supply and prices go up, not down. So the solution to price gouging is don't buy the product if it's a higher price than you are willing to pay. And I know people will say, \"Oh, well, yeah, but what about an emergency? It's a hurricane and people need sandwiches and bottles of water.\" Okay, yes, I get that. And fine, even if I wanted to say in a hurricane situation where people need things for survival because there's a natural disaster, all right, if you want to limit your price gouging laws to that, I still disagree because I still think the fundamental dynamics of supply and demand apply, and that's not me being cruel to people who are in an emergency situation. I'm saying that you have to have incentive for people to bring the good or service to the place where it is demanded. The incentive in that case is the price. And if there's someone willing to pay, like a price of generators goes through the roof because everybody wants electrical power, but the grid is down, whatever. If someone is willing to bring that good to the market there and there's someone willing to pay that much for it, guess what? That's a win-win for both parties. Instead, I guess the answer is, no, let's say you can't charge more than this, and what happens? The person who otherwise would bring the good or service to that market says, \"No, it's not worth my time because I had to go get this generator from some other place in the country and that cost me a bunch of money. But now, since I can't actually earn money on it, I'm not going to do it.\" Guess what? The supply doesn't get there. So does it feel unfair if prices go up in a time of a surge of demand like that? I guess, but that's subjective. The prices are determined by how much people want and are willing to pay for the product. And there's an incentive for a supplier to bring that product to market that way. That's how people get the supplies. Setting a price ceiling just creates the sort of scarcity we're trying to stop. Anyway, what I'm talking about here, the emergency situation, even though I want to say, \"Okay, I grant that. Let's just do the limited hurricane emergency scenario for our price gouging laws.\" That actually is the state status quo. So Elizabeth Warren's like, \"Oh, they already do this in all these states. Three dozen states. Haven't you heard?\" What do they have? They have laws about when and how prices can be raised in times of emergency. Those laws are triggered by an event, like a natural disaster. They're triggered by the governor declaring an emergency. They are limited in their time and place. They are not the sort of broad control of setting prices in the way that Kamala Harris is describing. There's nothing in Kamala Harris's proposal that talks about emergencies or that talks about specific limitations like we see in these laws. Where, okay, if there's a hurricane and the governor declares a natural disaster, you can't increase prices more than 10%, 25%. Kamala Harris is talking about taking control of this through the federal government. That's not local. That's not limited to the specific circumstances. That's not limited in time. It's just the federal government deciding, \"Nope, I don't think that sandwich is worth $10.\" And so we're going to crack down on Subway. We're going to crack down on the deli. To act like this is normal, again, when the prior Borat representative guy says, \"Oh, this is normal. It's just like property tax.\" Except it isn't. The federal government has never had any role in this area. Same with Elizabeth Warren. \"Oh, this is normal. Where have you been?\" The federal government has never had any role in this arena. Which is why Kamala Harris is advertising it as the first ever ban, federal ban, on price gouging in food. You can't have it both ways. Either it's the first ever or it's totally normal and we've done it a million times before. But anyway, that was Elizabeth Warren trying to make the argument. Some other election topics. Maybe Kamala Harris, if it's not too late, should get Politico to do the interview. Because this article from Politico, this is a special kind of pro-Kamala propaganda. Late yesterday, Politico published a story they have since retitled. It was originally, \"Our corrupt leadership, Vance tries to tether Harris to Biden during Michigan Rally.\" Vance tries to tether Kamala Harris and Joe Biden together. Now they've changed it to, \"Vance warns of China's influence during Michigan Rally.\" There's no editor's note on the story, as far as I can tell. One would assume the massive ratio they got on X for this headline had something to do with it. But from the story, \"Speaking at a big rally in Big Rapids, Michigan, former President Donald Trump's running mate tried to tie Harris to the Biden administration's policies, saying at one point that Kamala Harris has been calling the shots, while also warning of China's emergence as an economic superpower that's taking jobs away from the U.S.\" Yes, that's it. Jadie Vance tried to tether Biden and Harris together. That's all. They have no actual link, though, other than she is, of course, the current Vice President of the United States in the Biden administration, as one user noted. Let me grab it. It was a great tweet. Let me see if I can find it. It was about the actual tether. Yeah, I forgot to grab the story here. Yes, I went to the website and there I found the tether, actually. It's the dash between Biden-Harris in the Biden-Harris administration on WhiteHouse.gov. There's the tether. You guys missed it. So pretty good observation by that user. Meanwhile, there's been some dispute about... Hold on. Sorry, I got lost for a second. Some dispute about the debate coming up and whether that's actually going to happen. Kamala Harris, of course, the debate on September 10th on ABC between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. And Kamala Harris earlier this week had apparently tried to change the rules of the debate. The candidates had agreed that the rules would be the same as previously agreed to with Biden and the one on CNN, that the mics would be muted when that candidate isn't talking, and the candidates would be standing, and no notes and things like that would be allowed. Kamala Harris wanted to change that, and she wanted to make the rules mics on the whole time, so nobody's mics are cut at any point. They were going to sit, and apparently notes would be allowed, previously written notes. And through back and forth negotiation, I guess they've now actually agreed on the original rules. At least Trump said that yesterday morning, that we're going back to the original CNN debate rules from the Biden debate. The candidates will be standing, the mics will be muted for the candidate who isn't speaking, and you can't have pre-written notes. And I think these rules work to Trump's advantage, at least in my opinion. Number one, on standing, the taller candidate has won the election 60% of the time throughout this country's entire history, even back before candidates were seen on TV. Taller candidates have an advantage, that's why Kamala Harris wanted to sit. Number two, Trump not being able to interrupt limits one of his potential weaknesses, which is, of course, his tendency to interrupt. By letting Joe Biden talk, it was a huge advantage for Trump last time. And just like Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, the more she talks, the less likable she is, the less sense she makes. So just letting her talk is one of the best strategies that Trump has. It also neutralizes Kamala's probable strategy of trying to victimize herself. Remember, she did that during the vice presidential debate in 2020. Mike Pence was very polite, and any time he gently spoke over her, she would do that \"Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking\" bit. \"I'm speaking, I'm speaking, because I'm a victim woman\" is the idea. If the mics are muted, she's not going to be able to do that. Again, advantage Trump. Alright, we're at the top of the hour. There was another story on voter registration that I wanted to talk about, but I just don't think we're going to have time. So, Tim, I'm going to boot that one, and maybe I'll come back to it on Sunday. Yep, no worries. It's a good story, though. TLDR, Kamala Harris is inspiring record voter registration, double, triple voter registration for black women in particular, but Democrats are getting a massive voter registration advantage in recent weeks relative to 2020. So, something to keep an eye on. We do also have the Jack Smith story, I assume you want to get to that. Yeah, I'm just going to skip this one, because I want to talk about those, and then I'll get to the email question. But maybe I'll save this one for my Sunday show. Lastly, in election happenings, R.F.K., of course, R.F.K. Jr. suspended his campaign, endorsed Trump. He is staying on the ballot in red states and blue states, but he's leaving the ballot in battleground states, except for Michigan. Michigan is not letting R.F.K. Jr. off the ballot, because according to the Secretary of State, minor party candidates cannot withdraw. So, R.F.K. Jr.'s name will remain on the ballot in the November election. And I'm not familiar with Michigan election law, so I guess this could be correct. I haven't seen the statutory citation. I have my doubts on the headline level that that's actually what Michigan law says, though I will happily be corrected on that. But this does seem a lot more like Democrats operating in terms of what's convenient for them. I noticed that the Democratic Party had tried to sue R.F.K. off the ballot everywhere else. But now that they've determined that his presence on the ballot might hurt Trump, well, now he must stay on the ballot. I've never heard of this kind of law. Like, once you qualify, you have to be on the ballot by force. But I guess that's what's going on in Michigan. All right, quickly, I want to give an update on what's going on with the Trump criminal prosecutions, because they're still not dead. They're just mostly dead, but man, Jack Smith is still trying to revive them. This week, there are big updates in both of the federal criminal prosecutions under special counsel Jack Smith. And recall that both of these took a massive hit recently. The January 6th case got appealed to the Supreme Court on presidential immunity grounds. And the Supreme Court issued a landmark decision outlining the rules for what conduct is immune from prosecution for the president. And the rules were for official acts, constitutionally assigned acts of the president. He's immune from prosecution on those. The president has presumptive immunity for acts that are kind of tangentially related to his constitutionally assigned duties. And for things that are totally outside the scope of his constitutional job, things he does in his own personal capacity, there's no immunity on those. And that means what? That means Jack Smith's entire January 6th case has to go back to the trial court and get reworked under these rules. On the classified documents case, the judge in Florida threw that out on the grounds that Jack Smith's entire office is unconstitutional, actually. That his special counsel office is not created by Congress as constitutionally required. The DOJ argues that existing law authorizes the creation of Jack Smith's office. That's all highly debatable, but that case is on life support for that reason. But the January 6th case, Jack Smith has brought a new indictment already. The charges remain the same. Jack Smith just reworked it a little bit to remove references to things that could be perceived as official acts, which of course are constitutionally protected according to the Supreme Court now. So Jack Smith presented this new slimmed down case to a new grand jury to secure a new indictment. The Justice Department is not asking Trump to reappear for arraignment this time. It's functionally the same case, just with a little bit, I guess, less evidence or discussion of things that might be constitutionally prohibited from introduction as evidence. Judge Tanya Chutkin is still on the case, and she's going to have to evaluate all of this evidence in terms of what is admissible in the case under the Supreme Court's presidential immunity doctrine now. That's going to take a while. Zero chance this goes to trial before the election, but again, that doesn't necessarily mean that it's dead. Which I'll discuss more about in a moment. But then we have the classified documents case. Jack Smith has also appealed that one. So he's reviving that one, too. It's now appealed to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. Jack Smith says that Judge Cannon's conclusion in that case, that his office was not constitutionally authorized, is \"novel and lacks merit.\" Jack Smith is pointing to other special counsel cases past and present, including the case against Hunter Biden, saying this decision would invalidate those special counsel appointments. But there's a big problem for Jack Smith that, as far as I've seen, I haven't read the full 81-page filing in this, but as far as I've seen on the coverage of this, there's a big problem that Jack Smith is not addressing in what I've seen. And that is that all of these other special counsels that he's referencing are U.S. attorneys. They are presidentially nominated U.S. Senate-confirmed U.S. attorneys. Jack Smith was never a U.S. attorney. He was an acting U.S. attorney for five seconds. He was a substitute. He was a fill-in. But he has never been an official U.S. attorney. He's just a guy off the street that Merrick Garland picked. He was prosecuting war crimes in Europe before this. How this is going to play out in the appeals court, yet to be seen. The 11th Circuit is generally viewed as ideologically conservative, but it'll be up to a three-judge panel. We don't know what judges are going to be on that panel, so we'll have to wait and see. Regardless, this case, too, is going to take months or years to resolve. Nothing in this case is happening before the election. Nothing meaningful, anyway. But then there's the question, what about after the election? Of course, if Trump wins, these cases are dead because he'll direct the Justice Department to drop them. What if Kamala wins, though? If Kamala wins, you can bet these cases will be pursued to the end of the earth. It is not going to be enough just to beat Donald Trump electorally with all of their fortified assistance. They'll do everything they can to put him in prison. And of course, if they secure a conviction in these cases, the fact that he's now a convicted felon, courtesy of the state of New York, it's all the more reason to treat him harshly as far as sentencing. The case to imprison him is strengthened. Speaking of, there's still a major election shakeup possible. Now, it is a long shot, so I don't mean to say this is a prediction, but it does actually remain possible that Donald Trump goes to jail. Donald Trump goes to prison before Election Day. As of now, September 18th is still the sentencing date in the New York Stormy Daniels case. Sentencing was originally scheduled for July, then the Supreme Court immunity decision hit and the judge delayed to September. Because the Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity has implications in this case, obviously the conduct in this case was about Trump's, the conduct in this case was Trump's interaction with Stormy Daniels back in, I mean, the original alleged encounter was back in 2006, but then the actual hush money payment at the center of this was when Trump was running for office in 2015, 2016. So what does the presidential immunity doctrine from the Supreme Court have to do with this? Well, a lot of the evidence introduced at trial was from Trump's time as president. So was that evidence constitutionally introduced? Was it constitutionally eligible or not? That remains to be seen in this case. Trump's lawyers asked Judge Mershon, the judge in this case, to toss the conviction on the basis of the Supreme Court's decision, that they used evidence that was from his time as president and therefore the conviction is invalid. Prosecutors don't want that, obviously. So the judge has a decision to make. Am I going to toss the conviction or not? Presumably the judge agrees with prosecutors. In that case, Trump can appeal. So the question is, will the judge sentence Trump on September 18th as scheduled or will he delay the sentencing to allow Trump to appeal on these presidential immunity grounds? And the judge has a lot of discretion in this. The judge can sentence Trump on September 18th as planned. And what the sentence is, is entirely up to the judge. And when Trump must serve a sentence is entirely up to the judge. It could be immediate, though that is unlikely, because even if the judge decided, \"I'm going to sentence him to prison,\" in all likelihood he would say, \"I'm not going to make you serve prison until you've exercised your appeal rights.\" So that's probably the most likely outcome, even if there is a prison sentence. Trump doesn't actually go to prison before the election. It still remains possible, though. The judge could do that. And what makes me nervous about all this is why do you go through all of this? Why do you go this far if you're just going to stop? Why aren't you going to go to the full extent? What's the point of this show if you're not going to see it realized? So unlikely, but remains possible. And like I said, everything in the last four years has been like, \"Oh, there's no way that's going to happen. It's too ridiculous.\" They would never do that. And then they do. So will they do that on September 18th? We'll find out in a few weeks' time, unless something changes. But my bet will always be on the show getting even crazier, even if the odds are long. All right, Tim, let's get into our email question. Now this one is a follow-up from a previous email from Aggie Engineer. \"Howdy, Matt. In my prior question, I asked if restricting voting rights of people who do not have the nation's best interests at heart was justified. As a follow-up, how should we determine who does get to vote? The obvious restrictions would be to give one vote per stable nuclear family unit, but this could be abused in the same way green card marriages and anchor babies are used to defraud our immigration system. What criteria would you use to determine if a person or a family should be given the vote?\" Yeah, I am open to the idea that you just advanced, Aggie Jet Pilot, which is the idea of a vote per family rather than a vote per individual. Reason being that it places the vote within the building block of society, the family. So I think that's a plausible idea, but some other considerations to add onto your thought, especially on votes involving property tax. How about property owners, property ownership as a condition or a qualifier for voting? And especially with matters of property tax, it's just on the principle that those who don't actually own property, those who don't have that investment in the community, shouldn't be voting on the management of that property, shouldn't vote on matters that directly affect the ownership of that property. Property ownership is a stake in the community. You don't vote with short-sighted foolishness when you actually have an investment in that community. So property ownership I think is a worthy consideration. To your point on problems with immigration potentially, what about some sort of time consideration? You have to have lived in this jurisdiction for X amount of time or owned property within this jurisdiction for X amount of time. And I would apply that just as consistently to myself as I would anybody else. If I moved to California tomorrow, I did live in California for two years, 2010 to 2012, but I haven't lived there in a dozen years now. What right do I have to go to California tomorrow and start bossing California around? I know that's probably an exaggeration. A vote is -- you're not the boss, but it's a mini exercise in bossing people around. What right do I have to go to California and exercise power over how those people manage their state since I just showed up yesterday and I don't necessarily own any property there? I would say the same thing for Californians coming to Montana. If a million Californians decide tomorrow they all just want to show up in Montana and they effectively outnumber us at that point because our state is only population one million or a little over, what right do they have to show up today and start bossing us around and how our state is going to be managed from this day forward? A time consideration, if you make a time limitation in that way, number one, it increases the likelihood that the person is actually going to make the sort of investment in that state or community that will establish a stake, that does make for a qualified vote in the way I'm describing. And number two, it makes it more likely that they'll assimilate to that place. You'll start to understand the culture of that place. You'll start to understand the people who live there. You're not going to show up and immediately try to change the way things operate there. A little bit of exposure to see how they do it, I think, is a good prerequisite to making decisions about how that place should be run. And whenever people talk about limitations on voting rights, there's a natural discomfort with that. What are you talking about? You can't restrict the right to vote? That's the most fundamental thing we have. It actually isn't, at least I don't think, because voting as a right is a totally different type of right than all the others. When we talk about your right to speech, to say whatever you believe to be true, to speak freely, your right to defend yourself, to arm yourself for the purpose of defense, your right to fair process in a court of law, those are all negative rights. They're rights to be left alone. The right to vote is something else. The right to vote is a so-called right to exercise power over your neighbors. It's not the right to be left alone. It's the right to have a say in how that other guy over there is controlled or what the rules of his life are. That's why it's fundamentally different. That's why there ought to be certain qualifications for it, certain criteria for it. I don't view limitations on the right to vote as the same thing as, say, limitations on your right to speak your mind, your right to defend yourself, all the other Bill of Rights rights that we think of. The right to vote is not actually in there. It is implicitly through the guarantee of a Republican form of government, but there's nothing about the federal constitution that says that states can't determine voter eligibility, and states do all the time. Look at the way states treat the issue of criminals voting. There are all sorts of rules on that. Over time, the issue has been federalized, but under the original intent of the constitution, it was not. States were to determine these matters for themselves, and I think states would be wise to think about some reasonable limitations on that and to require some investment within their state or some investment within the community before awarding that right to people who may change it fundamentally. But thank you, Aggie engineer. And as a reminder, if you'd like to send a question for consideration on the show, the way to do that is through the contact page of my website, mattchristensenmedia.com/contact. Look for that MC hour questions box. All right, Tim, time to get to super chat before we call it a night. No worries. It doesn't look like we have anything in YouTube. I'll make sure to check it before we go. So let's go to rumble. So from looks like it's all from GI tokens. No, sorry. Hey, I'm not going to. Thanks for thanks for ruining the movie review for the pig is do you understand why it couldn't be or do they understand rather why it couldn't be five or six picks instead of four. We also guessed one's nerd pig. Hey, man, that's a blonde thing. She needs to learn to disguise her pics better. But I don't see how that ruins the review for the pickers. The pickers. Anyway, I can't get into the details on this because that's a Sunday thing. You know, the the rules of the movie selection have changed slightly. Now, man, the pickers still have a numerical advantage. The audience member is picking five of them. Blonde and I are just submitting one each. And you got to pick movies that people want to watch. I don't think that's an unfair ask. Just like I just like I was describing, there is no you don't necessarily have a right to exercise control over your neighbors. You don't necessarily have a have a right to tell me what movie I must watch. So there will be appropriate limitations on the movie selection as well. Thank you. Yeah, I do emphasize to people when I send out for the actual pick is to say, guys, keep in mind that people might not like it. I think it was Celery Salt. I feel bad for him. Yeah, I think it was Celery Salt. He had a lot of very obscure movies. Now, I'm a big movie guy, so I knew most of them, but I knew that most people wouldn't have never heard of them. So, yeah, it is something they need to keep in mind. You got to have broad appeal. That's part of the bit. But again, I'll keep it moving because that's a Sunday show thing. We can we can get into the debate there, GR. Fair enough. White House my ass. I went to Facebook jail for posting a Rittenhouse meme with PJ's head slapped onto my 90s group. They accused me of promoting terrorism. I literally got unbanned one hour after verdict. Weird. OK, so once that once a court of law had determined that Kyle Rittenhouse was not a criminal, then your post was OK. That's OK. I guess that's how we're going to operate. Yeah, I mean, to be fair, I think what he's saying is the the services themselves do a lot of censorship, which I mean, yeah, they do. But it doesn't mean that the government pushing forward is in any way. Yeah, I don't doubt that there's a lot of ideological convergence, that they're friendly in a lot of ways, even if it's material that Facebook would. Censor on its own or would like to censor the White House assist in that matter still still matters. Like let's say they agree perfectly and we don't want, quote unquote, covid misinformation. If you got officials from the White House collecting the post to be banned and assisting them in that effort. But the fact that that it's not an adversarial relationship doesn't change the fact that the White House is still assisting a third party, a private actor to do the censorship that the White House wants, but can't actually do constitutionally. And I know G.R. isn't saying like they should be. He's not justifying. He's just saying that Facebook is doing a lot of this on their own behalf. Yeah, I don't dispute that point. I just don't think it. Obviously, it doesn't justify the White House either. So the next one from G.R. Jack Smith once chased me on a playground. I said I didn't want any free ice cream, but he appealed and persisted until a nice Colombian nice Colombian came and helped me. Somebody please stop this illegal hunting. Yeah, I guess. Well, Jack Smith is is doing that kind of treatment to to Trump. We'll see if he realizes we'll see if he realizes the fruits of his prosecution. I mean, if Kamala Harris ends up the the president United States, they you know, the direction that those prosecutions are going to go, it it's going to be ugly. It's it's going to be very, very bad. Unfortunate for America. Dana Bash, Dana Bash, if if they pursue these prosecutions all the way until Trump is in prison. Yeah, I am kind of confused by people that are very insistent they're not going to put him in jail. It's like you would have said that about pretty much everything they've ever done against Trump. They're not going to impeach him twice. They're not going to. A couple of years ago is they're not going to criminally prosecute him. Yeah, exactly. I just look and go, why would you think they would? I mean, what's the point of criminally prosecuting him if you're not going to try and go the whole way through with what you're doing? It doesn't really make sense. Anyway, last one from here, saying that saying that Kennedy letter from RFK Junior siblings really disgusted me. My grandma drilled it into me that family is blood and loyalty is almost absolute. Anything short of attacking family is inbounds. Yeah, I had to come back. I know we talked about that on Sunday, but there was Kerry Kennedy has done the the news interview around since releasing that statement last weekend. And I just I can't believe how diseased this woman is to publicly trash her brother with rehearsed statements all over CNN and MSNBC all weekend. And how backward it is to say that because he disagrees with me on politics, I disown him. He's effectively not my brother anymore. Not only that, but he's a dishonor to my dead dad's memory and all this nonsense. The the betrayal of family in that way is absolutely disgusting. And that lady should be called out of the fact that she's celebrated by half the country for her courage or something like that. That lady is destroying the fundamental building block of society, the family unit. And if everybody did what she does, where you just turn your back on your family and on your siblings, on your spouse, on your on your dad, on your mom. All of our family relationships will erode and society will fall apart. And if you can't see that you're an idiot. It's one thing if your brother is a criminal, you know, he's a serial killer or something like that. He's in prison. Even then, though, I don't think you should go on TV and trash your brother as a virtue signaling exercise. It's appropriate to say, you know, my brother made some very poor choices in his life and he's now facing justice and the consequences for those choices. You don't you don't go on TV just to trash your family in the way that she is, especially over viewpoint. And I think it's such an important point that people should observe this. People should watch this because you don't want to become Kerry Kennedy. Kerry Kennedy is the sort of person who will destroy society through the destruction of her family. People follow her method. We will destroy the country. Some might say that's the point. I don't know. Yeah, I. I would be curious, did she ever design Teddy Kennedy? No, they don't. They love. They love Uncle Teddy. Yeah, I know. And he left a woman to die. It's so amazing to watch. It's like you people are you people are awful human beings. Hey, Ginger Ninja, we've had one come in on Rumble since I always have to watch the Sunday stream on replay. Here's my obligatory shackles. P.S. I'm bugging bonds to hop on here. Ray, Amish farmers, I assume there must be some sort of legal dispute with Amish farmers. It's yeah, he represents. What's that Amish farmer's name in Pennsylvania? Oh, he's had a big dispute with the federal government or the Pennsylvania government. I can't remember about the sale of milk. And I would like to talk to Robert Barnes about it, but I haven't been able to secure his time. And I don't encourage people to harass people on my behalf. But, you know, if you're friendly with Robert and you have some influence, go ahead. You want to do, you know, Mark Zuckerberg style pressure campaign on my behalf. I'm going to discourage that. But I might I might have to finish this thing then, because no luck yet. But I'm getting to nagging wife level. Oh, oh, I didn't see that part. You know, you're your own man. You're independent. But I'm not going to encourage nagging wife. I'm not going to encourage I got to be careful because that's a dangerous word. But I'm not going to encourage wife naggery on my behalf. Emphasis on the A in that word. Oh, people annoy me is coming to mind now. Anyway, that's right. Amos Miller's Organic Farm dot com, he says. It's Amos Miller is the name. All right. So we're all set for rumble. Yeah, I'm looking at YouTube. It doesn't look like something just came in. OK, that was the one you just read. Yeah. So that looks like it for rumble. And I'm not seeing anything on YouTube. So I think that's it. Yeah. All right. Well, thank you, Tim, for your assistance this evening, as always. Thank you, dear listener, for tuning in. Very much appreciated. It's always my honor to spend the evening with you. And of course, thanks to Tenet Media for hosting as well. Follow Tenet on X at WatchTenet now and Instagram at WatchTenet. We will be back Wednesday nights at nine Eastern Frank next week. This has been the Matt Christensen hour on Tenet Media. Have a great night."

    "transcript": "Well, can you explain the flags that you have for me here? Spokesman of Hamas. The green one is Hamas flag. This is jihad. Oh Fuck. I'm not gonna give me another warning. Get out of here. You're going to hell. Taylor Hansson with Tenant Media. Today I'm at the march on the DNC event.  It'll be held 4 days in a row where pro-Palestine protesters will be marching to the DNC in an attempt to get it shut down or to cause potential problems for the organizing of the event. And I'm gonna be going around here today asking people, are you withholding your vote for Kamala Harris as we all know, these are all originally Democratic voters, these people would be originally voting for the Democratic Party, but we're gonna see if they actually are now withholding their vote due to her stances on funding Israel. Let's go find out. So obviously, you know, 2024 election is coming up fast. Will you be personally withholding your vote for the Democratic Party or the Republican Party due to their, you know, stances on the Israel conflict right now? Yes, frankly, I don't think that genocide of Palestinians is an issue that is just far away that doesn't affect us. It does come back to us. We gave tens of billions of dollars to Israel over the past, you know, 8 months since October 7th that money didn't go to feeding our kids. That money didn't go to investing in our infrastructure. That money didn't go to funding schools. That money went to making bombs, and I think that in a way the Israel Palestine issue is the ultimate domestic issue when you look at the broader picture. Well, can you explain the flags that you have for me here? I recognize the, you know, the Palestine flag, but these three flags right here. Could you just explain them for me. This is a spokesman of Hamas called Abu Baider, and the green one is Hamas flag. It's a Hamas flag. And then what's this black one right here? This is jihad. Jihad. OK. So obviously the 2024 election is coming up fast. We see a lot of, you know, anti-Kamala, anti-J Joe Biden stuff here. Will you be withholding your vote on Kamala Harris in this election due to her stances on the Israel Gaza conflict? Well, among other things, I, I'm gonna vote Green Party. Jill Stein, yeah, yeah, OK, remember Gore Vidal, that famous,,, American,, author wrote, wrote all those and still I think is writing all these great, great,, books he one of his quotes was. We've had one party rule in this country since day one, the property party these two right wings, Democrats and Republicans. So the Green Party is your vote. Will you guys be withholding your vote for the Democratic Party in 2024 due to the Palestine issue? If the current policy continues, then yes, I will withhold my vote from the Democratic Party, which I've voted for consistently my entire adult life,, but enough is enough. A genocide is a red line for me,, and they've openly supported one. Now they still have time to change their stance to offer us something meaningful. If they do, I'll happily vote Democrat. So far they haven't. They have not earned my vote. Yeah, what she said on like almost exactly that, but I would still, I would, I'm like a dedicated voter. I always vote in every single election and then historically I've always voted Democrat,, and I agree they need to earn my vote this time around, and I've yet to see a single policy of Pamela Harris at all and then also. Anything different on the stands with Palestine and so if she doesn't change her policy then, or you know put an arms embargo at the very least I'm voting for Jill Stein. So what if you know the policy change that you guys would want, would it be a ceasefire? What would you guys like to see? I would like to see a weapons embargo. It's, it's become clear over the last few months that pressure doesn't work and that Israel, as long as they have the weaponry, they're going to keep attacking Palestinians and keep killing children. They've killed 16,000. Children so far, I shudder to think how many more they're willing to kill. Yeah, an arms embargo is absolutely necessary for me. I mean, we're the largest supplier of weapons to Israel, and that's the material thing that's fueling this genocide right now. I mean, at this point ceasefire is almost an empty word. They keep saying ceasefire and they killed,, you know, all the people negotiating for a ceasefire, so I just don't feel like those words mean anything anymore. So I need. I'm not voting this this time. Not worth it, be honest, Illinois is a blue state, and with the electoral college being a winner take all system, there's no point for me to vote whether if I supported the Democrats or not because enough of the state's going to vote Democratic where it's gonna go Democratic no matter what. And to be frank, the problem is the 12th Amendment to the US Constitution, and I encourage everybody to look it up. We need to get rid of the 12th Amendment. It's a garbage amendment. We overcorrected for a tie with Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr and I would like to see that replaced with some sort of ranked choice voting system where no longer the vice president and presidential tickets are paired together and instead the first place is the president and 2nd place is the vice president as it was up until the 12th Amendment was adopted. Which would mean you would most likely get a Democratic president and a Republican vice president or vice versa, and frankly that means there'd be more compromise. Will you personally be withholding your vote from the Democratic Party due to the Gaza Israel issue? I don't know what that means, so because, you know, they both, both sides are for funding Israel. What does that mean? So they, they don't want to support this essentially. What's happening? Are you here for the protest? I don't know what's going on here. Oh, OK, OK, that makes sense. You're OK. Neither one. You're not voting. I am, but neither one, not for Trump, not for Harris. So Green Party most likely is that where you're going? Maybe, maybe yes. I'm not gonna give you another warning. They're attacking me. They're attacking me. Get out of here. You're going out. Yeah. No justice, no peace. Free free Palestine. [ Indistinct shouting ] [ Shouting continues]"

I lost my job in 2021 due to vaccine mandates shortly after my first born arrived. We were blessed by circumstance but easily could have found ourselves in a very desperate situation with a newborn. The anxiety and stress at that time was immense. I have multiple family members who are have been severely injured by the shots - one of which is unlikely to live much longer. She is my 20 year old cousin who I am very close to and I must now mentally prepare myself to lose her. For my family members who supported these policies and forced vaccinations, through their vote and vocal advocacy, how am I to forgive them? How am I to have a normal/healthy relationship with them? The evil they have participated in is... well mind blowing. I don't believe I can ever look upon them in the same light. Is that so unreasonable? Am I the bad one here?\n\nI say all that to explain that I have some sympathy for the Kennedy's position when it comes to RFK. I just don't think they have proper justification to hold the position and are driven my ideological dogma rather than rational or real world consequences. I don't agree with their position, I think they are wrong to hold it, but I understand that a person can feel so strongly about something - even when it comes to their own family.",

    "transcript": "It is getting really tiresome to hear lectures about the fundamentals from people who totally misunderstand the fundamentals and I don't even mean just on politics like what's the right side of this issue or that issue or on? Constitutional law and how the government works. I mean on things way more important family Morality and God and how to handle these things where they come into conflict in that theme notably this week Kerry Kennedy Robert F. Kennedy jr. Sister released a public statement on behalf of four of her other siblings Condemning their brother for endorsing Donald Trump in joining his campaign accusing her brother of betraying the fundamental political values of their father and family name as though there are Political values more fundamental than family itself if politics is about building prosperity Well, a great way to prosper is not to drive family apart over politics but Kerry Kennedy must have been convinced that she wrote an excellent script to the contrary because She rehearsed and repeated it in multiple interviews over the weekend I'm outraged and disgusted by my brother's gaudy and obscene embrace of Donald Trump and I completely About and separate and disassociate myself from from Robert Kennedy jr. I'm outraged and disgusted by My brother's gaudy and obscene embrace of Donald Trump. I completely Disavow and separate and disassociate him Myself from him. I'm frankly outraged and disgusted by Bobby's My brother's gaudy and obscene embrace of Donald Trump and I noticed for some reason it is much more popular to interview the guy's sister Rather than the actual candidate with an actual base of voter support very strange Of course political disagreement within families even families built on political fame like this one are common There is a reason that the Thanksgiving dinner table is such a notoriously tense environment and there's nothing wrong with that disagreement There's nothing wrong with trying to persuade your family. There's nothing wrong with telling them that they're wrong In fact when you're right, that's called good leadership, but this stunt is not that this is not Reconciling family disputes within the walls of the home. This is public virtue signaling on the back of her brother This is a public show to make herself look good through a deliberate effort to make her brother look bad Preposterously claiming that she's protecting the family while she's actually stabbing it in the back hijacking her dead dad and Proclaiming that only she truly represents him as though Robert isn't just as much his son as she is his daughter and making it even more malicious for as soft as these interviews are and Challenging Kerry Kennedy to explain why she's so willing to betray her family so easily CNN host Kaitlyn Collins actually got a very important admission from Kerry Not only is she trashing her brother publicly, but she never even tried to talk to him privately Have you spoken to your brother lately? No, I haven't I Bobby I mean I saw him a few weeks ago at my daughter Mariah's wedding and But Bobby knows my view and and my feelings very very well So she makes zero effort to resolve a disagreement within her own family Before trashing her own brother publicly and somehow Collins thinks that this woman is deserving of sympathy That must be pretty difficult for you. Yeah, it's it's it's heartbreaking. How is it difficult for her? She's the one holding the knife with her brother's blood dripping off of it because I noticed in that story that she told her brother Did the right thing and came to her daughter's wedding? Despite the hostility. I noticed Bobby jr. Praises and understands his family in public commentary about them I noticed Bobby jr. Says I love my family end of sentence Qualified only by then defending their right to disagree with him unlike his sister who explicitly says I love my brother But as I say, I love him but I think that He's terribly terribly misguided. So what exactly is so difficult for her? living in a world where people sometimes gently disagree with her or having a brother who loves her unconditionally or Having a brother who supports her so thoroughly that he won't even trash her in response to her Trashing him. We should all be so lucky. That's not a difficult situation That's the ideal that is what's fundamental instead. Carrie has a long list of mistaken fundamental priorities Oh Bobby and Trump are wrong about constitutional rights Donald Trump is the polar opposite. He's a threat to most basic freedoms That are core to who we are as Americans the right for women to control our bodies The right to live in communities safe from gun violence to love who you love and I think if my dad were alive today The real Robert Kennedy would have detested almost everything Donald Trump represents. Yeah lady I don't think gay sex and killing your kids are actually the foundation of your Catholic family though I guess the Kennedys did do a lot of loving who they love as far as core American values if they are it's very strange that both of those things were Criminalized through most of this country's history until you invented a constitutional right to them five seconds ago now That's not commentary on what the law on those issues should be It's just recognition that they are not core to who we are as Americans She lectures us about how obviously correct she is on current politics as though it's so indisputable that Family separation over it is sensible and justified what? the current administration with the Biden Harris Administration has accomplished wages are up inflation is down small businesses are booming Manufacturing jobs are coming back. They've caught cap the cost of insulin to $35 a month for those on Medicare Lowing prescription drug costs on student loan relief to nearly 4 million Americans and the first bipartisan gun safety legislation 30 years The problem is it is not obviously correct In fact, it's entirely false real wages as in how much Americans earn factoring inflation a measure of how much the average wage Can actually buy real wages are down under Biden. Thanks to the inflation That's only down as she describes Relative to the worst inflation in 40 years under Biden year on year inflation today is still twice what it was When Trump left office and 50% higher than the Fed's target rate of 2% Business is not booming Corporate bankruptcies are with the first half of this year hitting the highest number in over a decade And it's great that you think that government intervention on medical costs saves money But it doesn't the price cap on medication just means the costs get made up elsewhere now in the form of higher premiums for consumers the student loan forgiveness scam was an unconstitutional power grab with further Inflationary effects because the government has to make up the money that is still owed to the loan processors likewise the bipartisan gun safety legislation has done nothing to help anyone or stop anything and defies the Constitutional truth that the federal government has no role in this domain Anyway, if your supposed achievement is a federal power grab that does nothing Well, then I guess I understand why you listed that one last even after all the lies But hey, I am actually missing the point by granting Kerry Kennedy's point that this list is even worth checking off Anyway, let's say that every political point that she just made is correct. The economy is actually awesome Quality health care is cheap and Joe Biden Personally took a bullet for you better than the Secret Service agents do or don't even if all of those things are true So what does any of that matter more than family integrity? Then keeping families together that is to say if you could have a country where all of those things were true But families break apart to achieve it. Is that actually a country we should want? Anyway implicit in Kerry Kennedy's reasoning is that government solves problems better than families do But of course it doesn't it makes problems worse almost always if you want to fix Problems if you want to help people in need the way that you do that is through family not despite it So why is family loyalty so important? Why is blood thicker than water? Why is the saying God family country in that order? We hear these things all the time But what is it that actually makes them true? It's because it is through family that people actually live prosperous lives and recover from hard times who helps a struggling poor person more a bureaucrat with a government check or a Family who loves him and can care for him personally if you have a problem or you have a difficult situation And you need help who would you rather see your brother your sister your mom or your dad or? The disinterested and disgruntled lady at the DMV if you would want that family member Then you must be that family member too And you must extend a special loyalty and a broad forgiveness to family not just because they are your family But because doing that is how everyone and society at large succeeds Yourself included family builds prosperity not the government if all other social institutions collapse It will be family that rebuilds them not the IRS. Actually, that's a bad example since they are so Cockroach Ian and their resilience if there actually is a nuclear apocalypse The IRS office may be the only thing still standing In fact, they do have a plan for that after the bomb drops you have 30 days until they start collecting again According to official policy, but you get what I mean strong society is not built on bureaucracy Strong society is built on mom and dad Son and daughter brother and sister and beyond and by preserving that bond as tightly as possible We preserve ourselves and each other if instead we betray that bond on whims We destroy ourselves and each other which is why Ironically if we follow Kerry Kennedy's model We are on the path to the very poverty and suffering that she says she's fighting destroy your family for the sake of the party Destroy your family for the sake of the state destroy your family for the sake of social media praise from people who don't even Know you and don't even care about you at all But if you destroy family you destroy everything because there's nothing successful to be built on any Substitute foundation and that is especially true in the context of viewpoints or opinions the way she's talking You'd think that Bobby asked her to bury a body like uncle Teddy actually did No, he's just asking her to consider viewpoints other than her own and have the basic tolerance Otherwise praised as so virtuous but noticeably absent in this particular case for some reason to respect the rights of others. To hold them to that point God family country in that order. What does that imply? Yes, there is a moral truth that pre-exists family and around which family is organized That is the God concept. There is a moral order there is a natural law to the world, but when you've determined that political disagreement is the sort of Violation of that order that's more important than family itself. Well now you've inverted the priorities now It's state over family now. It's party over family now. It's politics and government as God himself. And if you worship government or a political party as a God substitute you will soon suffer the consequences of that mistake as history repeatedly demonstrates forget helping the poor Nobody creates more poverty than a centralized power with a God complex. But thankfully Carrie herself won't have such an opportunity for all her ridicule for her brother. She is much further away from power than him he's not banished she is to the loneliest place where all meaningful influence goes to die a CNN interview.

    "transcript": "Conservatives..It's weird. There there are people like right now in the chat saying you know we don't want to live around high crime areas so we don't want to live around black people. And I'm like it's racist to assume that you're going to get that. I recognize they're talking about you know patterns or whatever it is they're looking at a crime stat, but it's funny that on the left. They they will not, they, there's that famous tweet from the riots during the summer of love where the guy in Beverly Hills is cheering on the riots. And then all his tweets like, \"Yeah, get 'em, get 'em.\" And then like a few hours later, he's like, \"Stay away from my house. What are you doing? Help me, help me, no.\" They don't wanna live near black people. They wanna pretend like they actually care. And so they have this like weird, \"We are so noble and just\" kind of racism. And then you have on the right people being like, \"No, they have their own agency. They can do whatever they want.\" And it's kind of weird that conservatives have this, \"I will treat you as I would treat anybody else. And for certain reasons, I don't wanna be near you.\" And the liberals lie about it, but like pretend to not be racist, but then act like- - I mean, they're two sides of the same coin. I mean, even when you look at the folks coming across the border, we say, \"Look, we have no space for 'em. Get 'em a room in your house.\" They like, \"No, we ain't got no room in the house.\" (both laughing) So they're always definitely hypocritical. They'll be out there fighting for 'em, but they won't actually wanna live next to 'em or then let a shelter come up in their neighborhood or apartment building in their neighborhood full of 'em. Then they're gonna be at the Alderman office like, \"Oh, heck no, it's too much going on.\" So I definitely feel where you're coming from, but I think they both have their own, they both are similar in their own ways. One just hides it and one just upfront with it. And I think that, yeah. - It's like one is almost like, right, honest about, \"Hey man, look, you do your thing.\" They're gonna talk to you like they talk to anybody else. And then they're gonna tell you exactly like, \"Look, I look at these crime stats. I don't wanna live in this neighborhood. I don't wanna live in a neighborhood with you.\" Liberals are like, \"Oh, you're so oppressed. That's so nice.\" \"Yeah, but you can't live near me.\" - Right. (laughs) - It's the virtue signaling. But so let's jump to the big question that I suppose. Is Trump actually winning over, they say it every year, right? \"Oh, the Republicans are gaining among black voters and there are some conservative commentators who are just like, \"Shut up, that's not true.\" - Right. - You said every time, you got these man in the street interviews where someone walks up to a black man and they're like, \"Who you voting for?\" And they're like, \"I'm for Trump.\" - Right. - Is that real or is that like selective editing? - It's real, but here's the thing. It's real, but a lot of those people don't vote, right? So you got both sides, right? You got the sentiment, which is actually true in the neighborhoods, but those people ain't never voted before. (laughs) So they won't make the impact that we're talking about because they really probably not gonna vote. But the sentiment is true for sure. When you look at what has happened over the last 16 years, Democrats have had it for 12, right? People are in a tough position right now. So it's kind of hard for Kamala to sit there and tell them that things are going well when they know that it isn't, right? And Trump, he had the four years that he had and he had a couple years after COVID where a lot of folks were making a lot of money from PPPs and SBA loans and money was flowing, as we should know, right? In the neighborhoods like never before. And so then you had Joe Biden where groceries are high, gas is high, and everyone's been broke, even if he had some money for the last few years. So people are going back to thinking about the time where the last time they had some money and the last time they had some money was when Trump was in office because after COVID, they had all those government resources. So that sentiment is still in the neighborhoods because throughout Joe Biden's term, everybody been broke. - I mean, you hit the nail on the head. We're also just tired of our faces being played in. It's like, you can only lie to us so many times. You can only pretend like you're going to help us so many times because in 2020, I had just become a Trump supporter like pretty much right before the election essentially and got red pilled that whole year. And I remember so vividly because I used to support BLM and Joe Biden talking so much about how he wanted to bring all this racial justice. And then next year comes around and he won't answer a phone call. He won't talk to anybody. He's not doing anything in the black community and black people remember that. And you can only try to win our votes over through culture and through rappers so many times before we start to see through it. Having Meg Thee Stallion twerk is not going to bring no new votes. - Did you like the twerking though? - I mean, I wasn't mad at it. (all laughing) My TV was turned on. It's like, yeah, we'll watch, we'll entertain. And like, it's fun. It's like, I would love to go have mimosas with Kamala Harris. She seems like she has a great personality, but it's like, that doesn't mean being sarcastic there. But she is funny though. I feel like we definitely would laugh. If we're going to do anything, we're going to laugh. Even if it's at nothing. But it's like, you can't keep doing that and not actually talking about policies or change or action. We want to see action. And one thing about Trump, he's going to get things done. And whether you like what he says, you like his rhetoric or not, at least you know what's coming. Because it's like, I would rather have someone who's a little ignorant, maybe says some things here and there that might rub me the wrong way, but at least I know how you feel. I'd rather see you coming and see a wolf coming rather than a wolf in sheep's clothing like a lot of these leftists who are actually racist, but pretend not to be. So we're waking up to that very quickly. - Does him being entertaining helps you support Trump? - Of course. I get into the antics and all of that, but when it comes down to it, I like his policies. Not all of his policies. I think some of his policies are a little crazy. - Like what? - I am not a big fan of no tax on tips. I'm also not the big-- - Why? - Because the thing is, if we're gonna have no tax for, or if we're gonna take, okay, first, let me go back. So if tips are a significant portion of your income, why are you not having to pay taxes on a significant portion of your income? And I still do. So my thing is, is you're going to be dropping the tax on tips. You should be just dropping the income taxes on everybody. I'm also not the biggest fan of the police immunity policy. I do feel like there needs to be, they need to restructure that whole thing where police officers are able to do their job, 'cause right now, police officers literally have their hands tied in a lot of these major cities where they can't do their job. - And I don't think he has a policy on that, really, because police already technically have immunity, and then when they ask him about it, he's like, well, there's gonna be a commission that looks at certain cases, and he don't even know what he talking about on that. So I definitely think that him spewing that is a problem. - So here's where I disagree with the tax on tips thing. I'm for it, but you are right. Because if they actually pass a law in Congress, Trump signs it, that says tips, gratuities, will no longer be taxed, here's the game plan. You want me to move your furniture for you? Oh, you know what? I do it at a discount. It's only 10 bucks for the whole day. Wink, give me a good tip. Because then you're, but here's the thing. If it just means less taxes for the government, then I'm like, fine, sure, whatever. But it just means every job is gonna move to a gratuity-based pay structure. Because the furniture-- - It helps all of us. - Yeah, it's like it's lowering taxes across, but you are right about that. No tax on tips means because the industry pays their staff through, I mean, it's socially required, basically. You can't not tip somebody, you'll get roasted. You'll get made fun of, the post on social media. So you have to do it, and then don't gotta pay taxes on it? Well, I'm fine with no income tax, so. - But I mean, and I'm fine with that too. I'm not a super fan of all these taxes either, but would you rather raise a federal minimum wage instead and keep the taxes on tips? - No. - And minimum wage applying to waitresses and waiters in the food industry? - No, waitresses and waiters, yes. Because when I learned about how a lot of them make a significantly lower amount-- - Correct, that's what I'm saying. - That's kinda crazy. - That's why they get tips. - I would agree with that. Now, as far as just everybody's minimum wage-- - So you would agree for, okay, but you would agree for the minimum wage to apply to them now instead of not taxing their tips? - Yes, because tipping culture has gotten out of control. I got chased out of a restaurant once because-- - That's a left policy right there now. - Is it? - Oh, I know. I have some, I didn't leave the cult of the left to just go be on the cult of the right and have no objectivity towards this that I have to say. But I got chased out of a restaurant once 'cause I left a tip in cash on the table, but he didn't see the cash. - Oh, wow. - And I wrote zero on the tip because it was all in cash. Now I know you're supposed to write cash. I didn't know that 'cause I rarely ever-- - You're supposed to write cash? - Well, because-- - I had no idea that. (laughing) - So there's a wink, wink, nudge, nudge, always tip in cash because then the taxes is on them. - Correct. - But if you put a line through the tip section and then put a $20 bill underneath and they don't see it, they're gonna run you down. They're gonna come on and be like, \"Well, they ain't never ran me down.\" - He literally sprinted out. And it was a nice restaurant too. I'm sitting there feeling bougie, feeling myself walking out. - Right. - Feeling good with my group of friends. And I covered the bill, so I'm really feeling like I just flexed a little bit. And he's screaming at me in front of all these people. And I'm like, the tip is on the table. - Nah, you know what I would've done? You know what I would've done? I'd have been like, \"Hey, my guy, come with me.\" I'd walk up to the table, I'd point to the money, I'd take it back. - You'd take it back. - Oh, I wanna show you this. I'm a Karen. I'm a black Karen. (laughing) - His bills were immediately affected because that was his last shift. I hope you enjoyed that tip. - Yeah. - But you know something that's interesting too that you were talking about earlier is you feel like black people should be independent. I will say I can understand why black people have so many issues, especially in a city like Chicago with both sides of the aisle. And I feel like while there are, and going back to your original question too, while there are a lot more black people who are supporting Trump now, I do think a lot of them are supporting Trump in theory because they like what he has to say more. But I don't think that they're turning up to the polls as much as they should be. And honestly, I've been saying for a while, if Republicans really wanna try to win what they should do is stop trying to get, I mean, they should keep trying, so let me correct that rhetoric, but I feel like a more realistic goal for Republicans is not to get black people to vote Republican, it's to get black people just not to vote for Democrats. Because a lot of these black people are just like, \"Okay, well, I definitely don't like the Democrats, \"so I'm just not gonna vote.\" - So you're for suppression? That sounds suppression. - No, I'm not saying I'm for it, but I'm saying that that's probably the smart strategy. - That's basically what you just said. (laughing) - It's the smart strategy to do. To suppress a vote, I'm against trying to suppress a vote. - I'm not trying to suppress a vote, even though I do feel like you should have to pass a competency test. - Wasn't that like a South Park episode or something? There was some comedy show where they were like, \"Just don't vote.\" And then they made the don't vote campaign. - The don't vote, oh, South Park, yeah. - I don't know if it was South Park or not, but they're like, \"We're never gonna convince black people to vote for us, \"so let's just tell 'em voting is dumb and don't do it. \"It's not cool.\" - See, I don't like that, but telling-- - It's basically what you're saying, though. I'm saying to educate them that voting for the left is not going to help you. It's like, I want them to vote for the right, but if you don't vote for the left and you don't vote at all, and that means the right has a better chance, then I'll tell you-- - What you wanna do is you wanna vote libertarian. - Ain't nobody voting for libertarian. (laughing) - Yeah, but to tell somebody not to vote is suppression, and we're against that. I mean, I'm just saying, but that's basically what you're saying. That's a bad strategy. - No, I'm for it. I'm for it. - You're for suppression of the vote. - So, I think suppression's kind of a loaded term. I would say, I'd go to someone and say, \"Do you know what you are voting for \"and who you are voting for?\" If the answer is no, you shouldn't vote. - Well, I-- - I can agree with that. - I disagree with that. - It's like handing a loaded gun to a child. - I think that more people should vote, and I think the problem is in this country and in cities all across this country is that people don't vote. So, you look at these cities and states, a majority of people are not voting. The majority of people, the majority of all states and cities are not voting at all. We should be getting more people to vote, because if you have more people voting, more of those people will actually vote the right way. - I disagree. - I think we should start with more people need to be educated what they're voting for. - Correct, correct. - So, here-- - But I think the ones that know what they should be voting for neglect to vote. - Agreed. - Yes, agreed. That's why I'm saying those people will decide the election. - I got a proposal then. We want to universal mail-in voting. We want to make sure every single person gets their ballot right in the mail with their name on it, very easy to fill out, and the ballot's blank. There's no names on it. It says city comptroller, city mayor, president, Congress, and you gotta write the name in. That's it. So, we encourage everybody to vote, and if you don't know the name of the person you're voting for, then it's a blank space. Good luck, have fun."

    "transcript": "Rfk Jr. hates the deep state maybe more than Donald Trump does this, you know, having your dad killed and your uncle killed, they'll do that to you, that'll radicalize a man. And the ties that bind seem to be assassination attempts between the two men and their deep seething hatred of this ghost in the machine, right? This deep state. Rfk Jr. presumably drops out tomorrow. That's what the reporting is. And the reporting also is that he'll endorse Trump. Your thoughts on that, you're a guy who has an interesting shades politically, and this would be, man, this is a wild look because you have Elon Musk on one side of Trump. You have Rfk Jr. on the other side of Trump. You have obviously the MAGA middle. And it seems to be the political unity ticket of a lot of our dreams. So I don't think there's a chance in hell that Rfk Jr. endorses Kamala Harris and Tim Waltz. In fact, I had I had gotten that they've said, yeah, they said that I got a pass into the Democratic Convention. I got an inside patch, an inner pass. And I was waiting because I wanted to ask Don Lemon because he was there. I saw him, but I couldn't get to him. I wanted to ask him, who do you think has a better rack, J.D. Vance or Tim Waltz? Right. And what a better guy to ask than John Lemon, who's gay and he would know. And but they they both have great racks, let's be honest. And I would say Tim Walz, because he's a little more feminine and feminine. And so he's got a jazz hand situation. Yeah, he goes hard on the jazz hands. But I've already forgotten the question because I'm three Negroni's in. OK, well, Rfk Jr. Rfk Jr., you guys are afraid he's been on your show now. So I have inexplicable great affection for Rfk Jr. He's appeared in my dreams many times and I'm a Jungian. So that is important and that's significant. But I did depart on him on his Israel policy. Now, I'm a radical when it comes to Israel. Right. And so I've been ostracized by Hollywood because of it. And, you know, I go so far as to say I don't think Israel has a right to exist. No country has a right to exist in that. I always thought before October 7th that Israel was invented as a result of the Holocaust. And that made sense to me. I'm like, well, we should we should we should give them a state. Then I found out that's not what Zionism is. Zionism started in the eighteen hundreds. And then there was the Balfour Declaration, which I didn't know anything about. And then there was the Nakba. So I so I learned all those things. And so I all my Jewish friends in in Hollywood, New York and Florida feel very safe without having a state of Israel. So and and so I can so and a lot of my viewers, by the way, disagree with me on this. And that's how, you know, my viewership is an occult because they disagree with me and they still watch. Sure. Right. A lot of people disagree with RFK on our channel, but they love the idea of Donald Trump bringing like more, more, more Americans into the fold. That's right. And unifying on the things that we agree with. Yes. And it's OK to talk with people who disagree with you and political consensus. That's how political consensus is made inside of a crucible. And so your thoughts on RFK Jr. perhaps being in a position of a position of a CIA director that would never happen? Maybe. I mean, you have to be Senate confirmed. You have to be Senate confirmed. That would be a hell of a fight. It would be amazing. But, you know, he could absolutely serve over. How about how about a human health and services? Totally. How about something like that? I would love. So, you know, Donald can FDA. How about how about our pharmaceuticals, our pharmaceuticals get pumped up search in general. Right. So what was revealed was even by Bill Gates revealed this, that Bobby Kennedy got the air of Donald Trump when it came to vaccines and they were going to have a Senate Vaccine Committee to look into the efficacy and the safety of vaccines. And why would you be against that? Because all we're going to find out is that vaccines are fantastic. Right. I mean, I I'm I would love to have RFK in a position that Trump offered Elon Musk, which is a government accountability like oversight, right, like an executive oversight of government accountability. I would love that. Like armies of lawyers, subpoena power and the executive branch, sort of a commission. And Elon Musk says he will serve on it. They did this during their X basis and RFK. I don't know, man. They're in Phoenix together. They're in Arizona together tomorrow. I'm feeling the vibes. I think RFK is going to drop out. I think he's going to endorse Trump. So even though, Benny, like I may you and I may disagree on many policy positions, sure. Like Frederick Douglass said, I will join with anyone to do good and no one to do bad. So wherever you and I agree, I would like to join with you to help and push things. And where we disagree, I would like to use the power of persuasion to get you to come to my side. But I agree with you with with the RFK. So that's why I think RFK and he should try to get a position in any administration, whether as Donald Trump's Kamala Harris or Richard Nixon's or whoever's right, he should try to get because I was I was saying before he wanted to have a vaccine commission before Covid happened and Bill Gates got the air of Donald Trump and Bill Gates said, no, don't do that. That's a bad thing, which is a direct quote from Bill Gates. And so Trump listened to that guy instead of Bobby Kennedy. And that was a mistake. Imagine if we had a vaccine commission before Covid, imagine how that would have changed everything. Right. It would have changed everything. So I really hope that no matter who the administration is, if it's Kamala Harris, it'll never be Bobby Kennedy. But Trump has a chance to bring Bobby Kennedy in. So there's that sliver of a chance. So that I hope it happens. I don't think Bobby Kennedy is going to endorse a Republican. But the Democrats have so screwed over by the third, the most undemocratic primaries. At least Republicans have Democratic primaries. Whoever wins the vote gets to be the thing. That's how Trump succeeded. In fact, he's probably smart to run as a Republican because, you know, Trump was he was never Republican or a Democrat until he ran and then he chose the Republican Party. Because when Bobby Kennedy came on my show the first time, I gave him a hard time. I said I would like to get excited about your your candidacy, but I can't because I know it's a fool's errand. Your candidacy is a fool's errand because they have superdelegates in the Democratic Party. They don't have that in the Republican Party. They have a superdelegate. And I said, Bobby, why do you think they have superdelegates so that a guy like you could never become the nominee? And soon enough. And he's disagreed with me. He fought back. He goes, I'm a Democrat. My dad was a Democrat. My uncle was a Democrat. I've been a long down life. Democrat Democrats are better than Republicans. He said that on my show. And then he ran for president. He realized those. Can I swear on those motherfuckers to the most anti-democratic Democrats in the history of the world. And so now it's to the point where people believe that he might endorse Donald Trump. That's how bad the Democrats are. That's how bad they are. You turned RFK Jr's son, who was an environmental champion of the left for a decade. People can now go kayaking in the Hudson because of Bobby Kennedy and his lawfare against corporations. And and now they've been turned into haters of Bobby Kennedy because of the money of Big Pharma, because Democrats under Bill Clinton's tutelage became the tools of military industrial complex Wall Street, Big Pharma and insurance companies and big oil. So if you remember, I don't know if you remember, you maybe you're too young to remember this, but when Bill Clinton became president, he did a thing called the Democratic Leadership Council, the DLC with Al Gore. And that was like they were going to be the new Democrats. Right. What did that mean? That meant they got so scared by Ronald Reagan that they decided to become tools of Wall Street. And so they said, hey, we're open for business. And on the Democratic Leadership Council, the DLC, they had Koch brothers executives on their DLC. So there was no difference. Bill Clinton, private. He did private prisons. He had one hundred thousand new cops. He bankrupted unions by doing NAFTA. That was the beauty of Trump. The first time he was against the WTO treaty. Right. And he did that. What's the Democrats report? Barack Obama's out there campaigning for the end. And Trump was against it. That was great. Right. So because NAFTA cut the legs out from underneath the unions for a generation, they still haven't recovered. So he did that. He privatized prisons. He wanted he gutted welfare at the same time. He imprisoned all those people with the with Joe Biden's crime bill. And then he was ready to privatize Social Security after after he deregulated Wall Street. He took away Glass-Steagall, which led to the crashing of Wall Street within 10 years. And he was going to privatize Social Security, except because he had a private secret deal. According to Thomas Frank, he had a secret deal with Newt Gingrich to privatize Social Security. And it was the blowjob from Monica Lewinsky story broke the night before he was going to announce that. So he couldn't he didn't have any political capital left anymore to do that. So that's so we owe a blowjob to having still having Social Security, which I'm a big fan of Social Security. I'm a big fan of a mixed economy. Right. So I think that the government should take the profits from oil and gas that's underneath the land that we all own and give it back to the people and not give it to Exxon and Shell and Mobile. That's what I believe. And I believe in a mix to come. There should be free market capitalism. And then there should be things that are privatized, I mean, things that are government run like that. Not only that, that government run per se, but the profits should come back to us anyway. The point is, Bill Clinton was no friend of the working man and neither was Joe Biden. That's the biggest joke. They just crushed a union strike and they're out there pretending. And then this speech is just was all poppycock. It was all just like Barack Obama's speech was bullshit. You see Michelle Obama say that my parents are always suspicious of people who took more than they needed. Lady, you have three homes on private islands, private, private, private freaking islands that like regular people can't get to acres on Martha's Vineyard. You know, he went to Barack Obama, had the balls to go to Africa and tell people that, you know, if everybody here has an air conditioner and a private car, the world's going to overheat. And then he goes back to his private house on Martha's Vineyard that has 40 acres. How many do you think air conditioners here? I'm going to guess at least 11 air conditioners. Then he has another house in Chicago and then he has another place in Maui and he builds a seawall. Did you know about the seawall? Yeah. He had to get an easement for it. Yeah. He broke every law in Maui. So because do it because. Yeah. So climate change laws say you can't have a seawall. And why can't you have a seawall in Maui? Because it creates beach erosion down the road. He didn't give a shit. He got a cut out to do that for his property. And it doesn't matter about the. So isn't it amazing that all the billionaires, Benny, that tell you that climate change is real and sea level rising, they they're all buying beachfront property. Is it that weird? Oprah spoke last night and she owns a thousand acre plantation. They still call it a plantation. She calls it a plantation on Maui. She's the biggest landowner in Maui, and she hasn't opened up a single acre to the people of Lahaina who had their entire home burned down, who were trapped in their city as it burned. The government trapped them in there and burned them alive. That's a matter of fact. The AP reported that only the people who disobeyed the government were the ones who survived. That's right. And Oprah has yet to open up a single acre of her thousand acres on a plantation. Yes, that's what it's called. For any of those people. Let me let people know how many acres that is. So if you have a hard time picture, have you ever been to Manhattan or you've been to Central Park? It's enormous. It goes on forever. So Central Park in New York City is less than a thousand acres. She owns more acres in Maui, an island than is the New York owns in Central Park. She hasn't opened up. I was thinking you could do like for not a lot of money. You could do like container like sort of homes like people have, like little homes. Right. You do like container. Yes. Give them a place to stay. You know, give us some like a place to stay. These people just had their lives like torched and they don't know where to go. And you've been there. I've been there. I see the people living in tents. They're living on the beach. I've been there. You see people spray painting on wall on building sites saying this is a land grab. And you know why they do that? Because it's a land grab. They wanted to burn the city down like isn't it weird? It's so weird that what are you going to put in there? The most sophisticated alarm system didn't just didn't work. They happened to cut off all the water. So the fire department couldn't use water to put out. These are just weird quickening. And then all the police and firemen were turning people back into the fire. It is. They're just coinkydinks. Did that. They sent them back into like what was an oven. These are coinkydinks. The government did. Yeah. All right. Well, remember, Oprah wants to raise money. What's us to donate? What's us to donate? Yeah. She could have five billion dollars. She's worth. She could have taken a billion dollars and restored Lahaina herself. She wanted you to do it. That's exactly what she gave. Ten million dollars. That's like me. Given a quarter. OK. So she didn't give anything. She owns five hundred million dollars in property herself anyway. And by the way, buying up all that property in Maui, the natives who live there are upset about it because that raises the price of all the land for everybody else in Maui. Of course. Yeah. It's scarcity. There's a homeless problem in Hawaii is a big problem. So Kamala Harris, that's the name of the night. Well, she was that you watched the speech. I watched about five minutes of it and it was fantastic. Oh, yeah. It was great. It was her pretending. It was all platitudes and bullshit, just like Michelle Obama, just like Barack Obama. At least Joe Biden has the balls to come on, just brazenly lie, yell and scream about it. But but like Kamala, what was weird to me, man, and I can't get this out of my head is she's in power right now. You're in charge. She's pretending like she's not in power. You're in power. You're playing your game. You're playing. And you're going to like tell us you're going to you're going to like seeing poor honey or poor honey in our ears for 10 minutes about your family and your aunties. And you're not going to tell us anything you're going to do for the damn country is places in shambles right now. I like you're in power. So I was I was inside the convention. I was on the floor for a little while in the last time I was on the floor for a Democratic convention was the last time I had one, because in 2020 covid, they didn't have one. So in 2016, I was in Philadelphia and I was on the floor. And it was interesting and exciting. And it made gave you hope about democracy. Why? Because half those people there were progressives who supported Bernie Sanders. So there was friction, which is what's supposed to happen at a convention. There's supposed to be friction and people are supposed to argue about policy. And that's what was happening there. Yes. The establishment eventually scared, you know, did whatever they did to Bernie and they threatened to prosecute his wife for the bullshit bank deal she did at the college or whatever. But he rolled over for them and and he didn't do anything with he didn't. Bernie Sanders didn't extract anything from the establishment for his support of Hillary Clinton. That's how it's supposed to work. You know, politics, Bernie. So if somebody wants you to get to endorse them, you have to give a concession. Bernie didn't get anything. Nothing. Got him. He got a new island house. They all get island house. So he got like three houses. He got a book deal. He became a millionaire. He's got a book deal. All that shit. He he became the banking chairman. All right. The progressives are like, well, Bernie is going to become the banking chairman. And what did that do for you? Fucking nothing. Anyway. So when I was there last time, it was fun to walk the floor. Yes. I would walk the floor and I would interview people and they had interesting ideas about policies. They all were understanding what Bernie was pushing and what Hillary was this time. It was the exact opposite. No one even cared about Paul. No one knew anything. I was interviewing one Democratic delegate and I said, hey, does it bother you that there wasn't a real there wasn't a real process for the primary this time to get the nominee? And the woman who I was talking to is a beautiful black woman. And she said, what do you mean? I don't know what you mean. We had a primary. I go. Yeah. So they switched it to the the usual primary starts in Iowa and then New Hampshire. They switched it to go start in South Carolina because that would benefit Joe Biden. And then they said, if you if anybody else campaigned into Iowa or New Hampshire, they would take away their delegates that they earned there. That's why that RFK had to leave the party, because they were putting in all these rules that would screw him. So he's like, I see what's happened. So that's the the opposite of democracy. So anyway, I said this to this woman and she said, I go, what, why don't you aren't you upset that there wasn't a real primary? And she says, what do you mean? They had a primary. And I said, no, no. Joe Biden won. And then they forced him out. Yeah. But there was a process, she said. And Kamala Harris followed the process of like, that's not called democracy. The process is called what a corporation does. That's that. And then I saw I was like, OK, well, she sounded exactly like a DNC delegate. Right. And I said, well, what's your favorite policy of Kamala Harris? And literally, she said to me, criminal justice, a black woman telling me her favorite policy of Kamala Harris is criminal justice. Kamala Harris is known for locking up black people for things that she was guilty of herself, hiding evidence that would exonerate them. And then after the Supreme Court told her to release prisoners from California's prisons, she still didn't. And the reason why she didn't do that they gave in court was because it would upset the prison labor system. Do you know what that's called? It's called slavery. I don't know if you know. So Kamala Harris was literally imposing slavery on black and brown people in California. And this woman who's a delegate to the DNC this year for Kamala Harris is telling me she likes her because of that. So it was honestly, Benny, I left there super depressed. Yeah. It was NBC World. We were there. I was there with Vivek and we were streaming, running around and just kind of like, you know, chewing a foul of people and kind of like kind of like kicking the doors in. Right. Like a little bit. Vivek knows that he's going to be recognized. People are going to yell and hiss and scream. And it's going to cause a little bit of a ruckus. And it was it was when Vivek was doing a fox hit, I just wandered around and looked at people and we did people watching, bro. It was like. It was zombies, glassy eyes, zombies, like glassy eyed people were kind of like walking as like very, very NPC, very much like an Android world. Right. It's like everyone had a neural link. Yes. Yeah. And they were all like on the same wavelength. And yes, our Kamala were and it's like a meme is like the chip was taken out. The Biden chip was taken out. And before the port even got cold, they shoved a Kamala clip in there and they were reprogramming update done algorithm activated. So like a convention traditionally is supposed to be where you get together and you knock heads and you work out policy and you find compromise. I didn't see a single Biden button. So I went around looking. I'm like, can anybody find me Biden? Jack? Nothing. A photo of a pashmina, whatever, dude, a lady in a wheelchair with like a little Biden sticker on her wheel. That's all I cared about. Find me a Biden thing. That, bro, that dude was straight up Stalinist level erased. He's been erased. Right. So that famous photo, Stalin and that guy and the guy's gone. Wasn't it? Wasn't it ironic? I don't know if you saw this part of the convention I did. They were holding up signs that saying we love you, Joe. And Joe Biden. All right. Right there. They had they had passed these out, obviously. And they're all that. We love you, Joe. Yeah. We love you so much that we could you enforced you out of a primary that you won. That's how much we love you. We want you to get the fuck out of here. And we're putting you on in the first night of the convention instead of the last night because we don't give a shit about you. We want people to forget about you. That's how much they love Joe Biden. That was amazing to me. [BLANK_AUDIO]"

    "transcript": "From my vantage point I think it's refreshing to finally see officers being allowed to do their job. I mean, look, I'm not seeing, you know, officers on the ground right now, you know, brutalizing people. What I am seeing is a bunch of far-left activists who aren't following orders, who aren't, you know, leaving the scene when they're being asked to disperse. And the activists, you know, charging towards officers. And when that happens, you have Chicago cops in riot gear, you know, again, taking people into custody. And that's what happened. The National Lawyers Guild of Chicago, you know, pretty much posted this morning that more than 70 people were arrested last night. Yeah, I saw that. Reports of dozens of arrests from, at least according to the reporting I'm looking at, a leftist group with militant leanings called Behind Enemy Lines. And then there's another group called Sammy Doon, Sammy Don't, I don't know what this is called, but they're saying it has terrorist connections. Do you know anything about that? Yeah, look, Matt, there are so many groups this week that have flown in from all over the U.S., right? Not just from Chicago. These are, you know, professional activists. And the bottom line is, all of them hate America. That's what it appears to be, based on the signs, the chants. These are communists and Marxists. These are people who want to bring a revolution to the U.S. They don't like the current free market capitalist system, right? They believe in socialism or communism, and then mix in the anarchists, who are there to take advantage of these moments to just cause chaos and destruction. And that's what you have. But again, I've covered a lot of these protests now, going all the way back to 2020 with the BLM riots, and I have never seen this many officers out on the streets, again, being given the green light to do their job. Yeah, I would imagine that has something to do with the politics in play here. But you mentioned the various interests that are present. This is being characterized as pro-Palestine, anti-Israel stuff, get the U.S. funding out of the war. Is that the predominant message, or is it just kind of a blob of leftist interest? Yeah, you hit it right on the head. It's a smorgasbord of everything. Everything under the sun. Look, I want to be very clear to your audience. I've been covering these protests since October 7th, since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. It started off with the pro-Palestine chants, free Gaza chants. But if you really go back to the history of all the groups that are fueling this, they all come from the communist, revolutionary, working-class Marxist camp. It's these young white kids with purple hair. It's Antifa mixed in, and they're pushing this. Again, this is all part of their messaging to take down the capitalist system. And they see Israel at the forefront of that right now. So this aligns perfectly with all of their other interests. But funny enough, you have a lot of Muslims now mixed in with these groups. And some of my Muslim colleagues and also friends will say, right now, we see them as useful idiots. But again, if you think about what all these far-left groups represent, especially LGBTQ, the Muslims, if you look at Islam, it's one of the most conservative faiths in the world. And they don't have anything to do with the lifestyle some of these people are living. Of course, the characterization is always mostly peaceful. How would you measure, I guess, what is the militant wing of what's going on versus the people who are there in good faith just to express their opinion? Yeah, look, there's no doubt, and in fairness, that some of these protests that have broken out across the U.S. for Palestine are mixed in with families, children. But on the ground here in Chicago right now, I've seen no kids. I've seen no families. I've seen no grandparents at these things. It's the professional. It's the 20-somethings with pink and purple hair. It's the Antifa folks wearing black block, and then everyone else covering their faces with kafiyas. And then you see their action two nights in a row now, night number one outside the United Center, you had Antifa militants taking apart pieces of the fencing, the security perimeter around the United Center, several arrests the first night. And then last night in front of the Israeli consulate, so far the largest clash with cops, more than 70 people arrested, according to reports on the ground. So we'll see what happens tonight and, of course, on the final night of the DNC. But all of this is happening outside of the DNC. For the most part, everything inside has been business according to plan. How is this influencing or interacting with the DNC itself, if at all? Is it having any consequence for the attendees? You know, I've got to give credit so far to the organizers of the DNC. To give you a sense of really what's happening here, the DNC is happening primarily in the United Center. Some of the other events happening in McCormick Place, this is all on the south side and west sides of Chicago, and it's heavily fortified. You're not getting in unless you have a badge, unless you have a media badge or a ticket to attend the DNC, and there's heavy security everywhere. Cops are constantly following the protesters, and the protests usually start at this place called Union Park, just minutes from the United Center. They gather there, they rally, they chant, they protest, and then they walk the streets. But then you have police choppers up, you've got officers with canines, you have the SWAT team trailing behind, firefighters, ambulances. So this is, again, an area right now of the city that is being watched very carefully, and I would argue, with all the cops, maybe the safest part of the city. I saw you posted on Monday that you heard some police saying they were potentially ready to deploy gas. Did that ever happen? No, it didn't, and that was the first night. I've heard officers say numerous times that they were going to deploy gas. In fact, one of the officers was heard on the recording telling his fellow officers to get ready as well. But again, the gas only would have been deployed if the militants refused to leave the area. But after some pushing and shoving, they eventually dispersed without the gas being fired at anybody. What's on the docket for today and tonight? What's coming up? Well, the DNC night three is happening inside. That, I'm assuming, is going to be everything according to plan. But what's happening outside is really where the intrigue is right now. There's another planned protest. There are also several communist and socialist gatherings where they talk about mobilizing and planning for the future. You know, last night I was at a local church that was being used by a group called Workers Strike Back. And it was a group of socialists that were really talking about what's at stake here in the U.S. And they're trying to use these national platforms like the DNC to really rally the troops and also indoctrinate and recruit into their organization. So it's just fascinating, Matt, right now what's happening in the U.S. You probably hear about this in mainstream corporate media, but all of these different groups outside of the Democrats and Republicans, you know, and I want to emphasize a lot of these protesters, they hate both parties. So you have people on the ground right now who want an alternative to the current free market capitalist system that's just not working out for them. Yeah, I turn on the news in the morning, excuse me, and it's like a five-second mention of what's going on outside. So in addition to just the volume and I suppose the at least marginal popularity of this ideology, what do you feel like is going on in Chicago that just isn't discussed in your traditional news channels? I mean, everything I laid out, there's nuance to what's going on. It's really a shame, you know, I haven't really had the time yet to look at some of the left-wing legacy media coverage from ABC, NBC, CBS. But, you know, that's why, you know, most of the reporting is coming, you know, on the ground from the independents, you know, and they're putting it on X and other social media platforms right now. But I think, you know, Americans need to wake up about what's happening. There is a revolution that is forming, mobilizing. We're seeing it real time right now outside of the United Center. You have groups, I want to be very clear, who have been flown in from all over the U.S. These protesters aren't just from Chicago. You have people from all over the U.S. who are like-minded, who don't believe in the current system. They don't believe in either political party. And they have a communist, Marxist ideology that they are trying to push, and they want to bring mainstream. And that's what's happening right now. That's why we're seeing these protests. It's not just a pro-Palestine protest out there. You have everything else under the sun, including reproductive rights. You have groups advocating for migrant rights. And, of course, you know, again, their own agenda. And then you just have people there that want to latch on and cause problems. So we'll see what happens tonight. Yeah, I'm trying to get a read about how serious these people are in their opposition. Because, of course, it's not the first time we've seen left-wingers protest the Democratic Party and then come home come Election Day. Do you have a sense, in talking to these people or interacting with them, how serious they are in their opposition? Do you think they'll come home come November? Or are they going to stand strong against the party? I mean, it's hard to tell. First of all, I haven't really had a chance to talk to the actual protesters on the ground because they're so focused on protesting. And I'm trying to stay safe by keeping a distance. But, again, by listening to the chants, reading the signs, I mean, these are the same folks. They don't subscribe to either party. They're holding their noses and maybe possibly voting for Democrats. These are far-left-leaning groups. They hate Trump no matter what, and they don't believe in Kamala Harris. And they want to bring their ideology into the national spotlight. And that's what they're ultimately trying to do with these protests."

    "transcript": "I actually didn't plan to do two abortion videos this week. But hey, I'm just responding to the priorities of the Democratic Party because I watched Kamala's entire acceptance speech. Not even for the false hope of Beyonce, but for the even slimmer prospect that maybe she might actually explain a policy position or two. And after over 15 minutes of talking about her childhood and her friends and her family and then almost 10 more of repeated \"but Trump\" warnings to preface any real plan, she finally got to some actual political issues and early, if not first among them, was abortion. \"Donald Trump hand-picked members of the United States Supreme Court to take away reproductive freedom.\" Because yeah, when she uses that word, or when she walks out on the stage to the Beyonce song of the same title, that is the first and really the only context in which she means it. The freedom to kill your kid. Not economic freedom. We got to centralize control over greed. Definitely not your Second Amendment freedom. After all, she can keep you way safer than you can. And certainly not your first freedom, the right to speak your mind. Her administration worked with the social media companies closely to make sure inconvenient voices were removed. And now the same supposedly right-wing activist Supreme Court she otherwise condemns said it's fine to keep doing it, or at least that the lawsuit against it was invalid on standing. But of course, she gives them no credit for that. Either way, you can bet that policy, void of any freedom, will continue. And so, in pursuit of that scam, the only freedom that matters is the freedom to erase and others, the convention featured one of the bigger recent scammers on that issue. You may recall the name Kate Cox. She's the Texas woman who became national news at the end of last year through her story that the state of Texas, through its Supreme Court, had supposedly attempted to force her to carry a non-viable baby, risking permanent damage to her future pregnancy prospects. And this, of course, is a clear demonstration of the foolishness of the US Supreme Court in overturning Roe v. Wade and Donald Trump for nominating the justices who did that, and Republicans in general for their supposed \"cruelty\" on this issue, a disconnect with voters that will surely haunt them electorally this year. Kate Cox has been making political appearances for Democrats ever since. She was Joe Biden's featured guest at the State of the Union address in March. \"Joining us tonight is Kate Cox, a wife and mother from Dallas. She's become pregnant again and had a fetus of a fatal condition. Because Texas law banned her ability to act, Kate and her husband had to leave the state to get what she needed.\" So it's unsurprising that she was a featured guest at the convention this week, too, making a special announcement to the crowd. \"Today, because I found a way to access abortion care, I am pregnant again.\" *crowd cheers* And hey, good for her and her family, congratulations. But it is at least a little odd for this crowd to be cheering that news, considering if she said, \"Hey, just kidding. I changed my mind. I'm gonna go kill it right now.\" They would also cheer. Probably louder, actually. And even if the story is true, \"Hey, I had to kill a kid to have another kid,\" that's still a very strange thing to cheer. There should be as much sadness in that reaction as there is happiness. But of course, only one of those kids counts, not by anything inherent to those lives or anything objective at all, but just by whether mom counts them or not. The problem is, very little about that story is actually true. So when Kamala takes the mic and asks, \"Why don't pro-life people trust women?\" \"One must ask, why exactly is it that they don't trust women?\" Well, because you often promote women who lie. That's why. Kate Cox included, and especially. Last year, Kate Cox's baby was diagnosed with trisomy 18, a genetic abnormality which is almost always fatal. Pregnancies with trisomy 18 most often end in miscarriage or stillbirth. Of those that make it to birth, 40% die in labor. Babies born alive with trisomy 18 usually die shortly thereafter. Only 10% make it to their first birthday. But Kate Cox's claim isn't just the non-viability of the baby. It's that giving that baby a chance would jeopardize her future pregnancy. She wants everyone to believe that the state of Texas sentenced her to sterility or something close to that. \"Doctors told us our baby would never survive. And if I didn't get an abortion, it would put a future pregnancy at risk.\" And so she had to flee her home, she says. \"Because of his abortion bans, I had to flee my home.\" Like she was guided by Harriet Tubman through the Underground Railroad or something. Flee, as though anyone was chasing her. No, she just had to drive a few hours to get her supposed \"medical treatment,\" as commonly happens for people of varying medical conditions every single day. But step back and think about the premises here. Yes, Texas is an abortion-restrictive state. But does it make sense that even Texas would crack down on a woman facing permanent physical consequences for carrying a non-viable baby? Is that even what Texas law says? No, it is not. Texas law says there is an exception, and a pregnant woman can have an abortion if it's necessary to save mom's life or a major bodily function. Ability to conceive and carry a baby in the future would certainly qualify as a major bodily function. So what gives here? Why don't these pieces align? Because Kate Cox isn't telling the truth about her pieces in that story. The Texas legislature and the Texas courts did not tell her that she has to carry this baby at the risk of not being able to get pregnant again in the future. She just made that up. In the Texas Supreme Court decision on the case last year, the court did not impose anything on Kate Cox. They said Texas law allows a doctor to exercise reasonable medical judgment. And if in that medical judgment, the abortion is necessary to save a major bodily function for mom, the abortion can proceed. The court emphasized they defer to the medical judgment of physicians as required by law. They are not imposing their own lawyerly views on the situation. And the problem for Kate Cox is her own doctor would not provide that reasonable medical judgment. Her own doctor would not say that the abortion was necessary to protect her physical health in the future. The doctor would not say that Kate Cox's life was threatened or that carrying the baby jeopardizes a major bodily function. The doctor would only say that she, the doctor, feared a state crackdown if she performed the abortion. But she offered no evidence that the state even tried to stop her because they didn't. The case doesn't originate from the doctor scheduling an abortion for Kate Cox and state agents raiding the clinic to stop it. The case originates from Kate Cox and the doctor bringing a lawsuit preemptively to stop any prospective enforcement against them. Indeed, there is no demonstration any state official ever enforced any Texas abortion law against Cox or her doctor. This case was never just some poor woman making a very difficult decision and then getting mercilessly persecuted by the state. This was an activist trying to carve a new legal pathway for a political agenda and then flipping the table and leaving when it didn't work. She wasn't chased out of town with pitchforks or torches, though perhaps she deserves to be. She left voluntarily with nobody threatening her at all. So she mischaracterized her own condition. She mischaracterized Texas law. She mischaracterized her treatment under that law. But as always, even that is not enough. She has to mischaracterize presidential politics, too, because, of course, somehow this is all Trump's fault. When she says his abortion bans, you know who she means. But Trump didn't care. And because of his abortion bans, I had to flee my home. Donald Trump has nothing to do with abortion policy in Texas other than seating Supreme Court justices who correctly recognize that how to handle abortion is constitutionally up to Texas and the rest of the states to decide. And if you don't like abortion policy in your state, that's fine. The solution, then, is to go to Austin and persuade. The solution is not D.C. gods in black robes steal political power from your neighbors and your state. And if going to Austin to persuade is too big of a task, well, there's always the option to move to another state that's more to your liking anyway. You already did a lot of that when you drove there. It's not the most convenient, sure, but the point is state political power preserves options. Would you rather have the option of greener grass on the other side of that fence or no green grass at all? Because federal tyrants boot stomped it dead. To close, Kate Cox insists that she is actually the pro-family, pro-life activist. There's nothing pro-family about abortion bans. There's nothing pro-life about letting women suffer and even die. What exactly is pro-family about killing family members unexplained? As far as her claim of a pro-life perspective, again, totally made up straw man. Texas condemns women to die. No, they don't. You weren't condemned to die because you never had a life threatening condition. And if you did, Texas makes an exception in that case. But the bigger point is this. Even if you think I'm being too harsh on poor Kate, what is she actually advocating? What are those people actually cheering? Because even if we fully grant the point, OK, Kate, you win. We should have a trisomy 18 exception, too. Babies with a low prospect for survival should also be an exception in the law. Those abortions should be legal, too. Is that enough? No, of course it's not. The intended conclusion is not abortion just in this very rare type of unfortunate case. The intended conclusion is abortion for any reason, at least within the first six months or so. Nationally mandated, as explained at the convention by the guy that we all forgot is still the actual president. That's why you have to elect a senator in the House to restore Roe v. Wade. So why are we arguing about this fringe exception when the intended rule is so much broader? If the case is so compelling and Kate and the party's position is so obviously correct, then why is the exaggeration and the mischaracterization and, yes, the outright lying even necessary? The truth is always the most convincing. So why opt for anything else if the truth is on your side? Because, of course, it isn't on their side. And if this nonsense is the closest they have to the truth, you can bet the depths of the rest of it are far worse. So why not trust women, Kamala? Well, show me some trustworthy ones and we'll talk. Because just like an abortion exception in Texas, Kate Cox certainly does not qualify. In fact, not even her doctor will testify that she does.

        "comment_text": "When Jamal Green says white or well off people don't experience the same as black whether they were turned down by a bank or anything else.  He is wrong.  I'm white and have been turned down by a bank.  I know plenty of white people who have been, regardless of their credit score.  When you talk about \"racial\" profiling, I feel it's bs.  I have biracial family and they make poor choices and claim racism.  When you allow your 13 yr old son out at midnight and a cop approches to ask why they aren't home, that's not racism, it's concern and statisitics.  The stats?  When a 13 yr old boys and his friends are out at midnight, the odds are, nothing good is going to happen.  When black men 18-24 commit the majority of violent crimes, it is crime statistics that drive the police.  How do you know you are being pulled over because of your race? You don't, you assume. Why do I say that?  Because I have a coworker who told me he went to a store and gave cash to a woman.  According to him, she wouldn't touch his hand and therefore, she was racist. The problem with this story is, it has happened to me too.  Sometimes, not always, but sometimes, when a black person feels something is racist, it isn't and unfortunately, the problem lies with the black person and what he/she was taught as a child and thru society about \"racist white people\".  Not every situation that makes you uncomfortable is about race, it's just the quirks of people.",

I was paid farm labor wages, which are well below govt mandated minimum wage.  WTF is the farm labor wage?  Well you get paid what the farmer can actually afford to pay, vs what the govt puts a gun to his head to force him to pay you, even when he doesn't have it, BECAUSE THE CROP PLANNED FOR DIDN'T COME OUT OF THE FIELD BECAUSE OF THE TORNADO, DROUGHT, LOCUSTS, FIRE, FLOOD AND other forces beyond his control. \n\nRestaurant waitstaff are considered sales staff, who work on commission.  The wage the restaurant pays you is a little bit of a cushion just in case you suck at earning tips, or there was some event that kept customers from coming in.  But that's how it works and for the longest time, tips were not taxed because they were not a guaranteed salary.  You might get tipped for your service, you might not, people are unpredictable.  \n\nBut the IRS is a very creative feeder of the indeterminate grower that is our Fed govt.  So it is constantly thinking of ways to grab more money from the People, or, legalized theft.   And thus the DemonKKKrats, per usual, pass a law that now starts taxing tips, thanks Kamala Harris for casting the tie breaking vote for it.  \n\nThe restaurant owner estimates your take and reports it.  Taxation with representation is no better than without.",

And he knows it. \n\nA lot of the land held by the Fed via the Bureau of Land Mgmt, the OG BLM, is not fit for human habitation.  Green goes all rainbows and pots of gold when he starts fantasizing about what will happen if only the blacks could have a bunch of cash handed to them and a plot of land out somewhere.  \n\nGreen is a communist.

    "transcript": "So last night, Kamala Harris gave her speech, and it's pure tribalism. You know, you get Jonathan Chait over at I think it's New York Mag saying, \"This is the greatest speech I've ever heard.\" And, you know, we watched it last night, fairly unenthused. You know, she was wishy-washy. The big deal, of course, was Israel. Seemed like she was gonna defend Israel, but then she defends Palestine, Gaza as well. And it's like, okay, you know, she's just, it's vanilla yogurt, I guess. I don't think it was all that great. The question is, how is this going to impact the voters? Is she gonna see it go up? Are her polls gonna go up? Are they gonna go down? I don't know. But the other question too is, one of the big, I suppose, political attack vectors was Donald Trump, of course, said that she was running this line, that she was Asian, South Asian for a long time. Then all of a sudden, one day, she was the first black candidate. And then the media attacked J.D. Vance and Trump saying, \"Oh, how dare you say she's not black?\" And so, that became some kind of weird talking point. But there's a real question as to whether or not Trump is winning over black voters. So, we've brought in some black political commentators. Not that I honestly think it matters, but, you know, we're here to see what you guys think and see if it's true or not. Would you like to introduce yourself first, Jamal? - Sure. J. Mall Green from the city of Chicago, former mayoral candidate. And Xavier. - Hello, sir. I'm Xavier DeRusso, a personality over at PragerU and frequent contributor on Fox News, Newsmax, and Piers Morgan. And from Chicago, but live in Los Angeles. - And that was the best thing, 'cause for the past 10 minutes, we were just all laughing together about being from Chicago and how the pizza, Chicago Tavern pizza's the best. Nothing else matters. Nobody knows what Giardiniera is. We have the best pizza, the best hot dogs. Everybody else was wrong. - Yes, we do. - Absolutely. - And the high blood pressure that comes with it. - They were, because the DNC is in Chicago, it's actually kind of funny, 'cause Fox and friends, they were eating hot dogs. And they were like, \"So this is a Chicago hot dog.\" And I'm like, \"What is that? Is it relish and celery salt and all that good stuff?\" So anyway, Chicago's fun. But what do you guys think? Kamala's speech, yay, nay? - I think that, I'll be honest, I fell asleep during Kamala's speech. I'll be honest. Maybe I was tired, maybe it was a speech. I don't know. But I think that I don't see it really moving the needle, how it should have. Especially when you just talked about the conflict with Palestine and Israel. I mean, I think you had the Palestinians outside where they were uncommitted because they wanted Kamala to say that she was for a ceasefire and she was for a weapons embargo. And then you have folks on the other side. So I think she was trying to cut the middle, and that's not gonna help her, right? Because both sides still feel like she's not doing enough. And Palestinians are saying, \"We wanted a weapons embargo,\" but she on stage said, \"We're gonna make sure they have anything that they need.\" And so I think that I saw a lot of folks crying, a lot of folks in the Palestinian movement on Twitter saying that they'll never vote, and it really depressed them. And I don't think it was a super powerful speech. And I thought that them faking like Beyonce was coming. I think, you know, to get everybody to watch and not get Beyonce, man, you know, that could've hurt them too. It's such a sleazy tactic. \"Oh, there's gonna be a special guest,\" and they post the letter B. So the rumor was also, I heard George W. Bush was gonna be there. I heard that. George came out and said he wasn't coming. Yeah. Taylor Swift, maybe. I think that says a lot right there. Even outside of what you think about her speech, the fact that they had to pull a stunt like that says even they don't think she's gonna have a big impact with her speech, and they were concerned people were gonna drop off. But the funny thing about the Israel-Palestine stuff, I think the reason she says both, she's like, \"The Palestinians are dying and we gotta save these lives,\" or whatever, it's because the clips. They want someone to just pull a one-minute clip, share it to all the pro-Israel people, one-minute clip, pro-Gaza people, and then talking out both sides of their mouth. Yeah. No, for sure. I mean, that was the whole approach to her speech. She was playing it very safe and trying to tiptoe in the water so she doesn't piss anybody off. Because right now, that could have been her moment to have this iconic speech that's really just a cornerstone moment of her entire career, but she didn't come out and say anything groundbreaking. She still really hasn't talked about policy. All she did was go out there and try to have this feel-good approach where it's everybody talking about joy. You see every single news station now is just saying how much joy they have because of Kamala Harris, and it's still that feel-good statement. But it's like joy isn't going to build us a border. Joy isn't going to end the wars that are overseas. It's like there's nothing that's actually substantial coming out of this Kamala Harris speech. But as far as how I think it went overall, if I was someone who didn't pay attention to politics, I would have thought it was decent. I mean, she's a decent speaker when she has a teleprompter in front of her. Otherwise, she goes into her word salad moments, but when she has a teleprompter, she tells a story. I was sitting there nodding. I'm like, \"Wow, your mom's a powerful woman. I'm not voting for your mom.\" Did you guys vote for Joe Biden? I did not. I did not. So neither of you are black? No, we're black. Isn't it wild that he said that, though? But I'm independent, right? And so my family has always voted for Democrats and everyone around me, and I became independent. I actually was a surrogate for Bernie Sanders when he first ran for president, right? So I was far left on a lot of different things at the time, but also still as a business owner, still conservative in that way. But I like Bernie because he actually stood on what he was talking about, right? He wasn't scared to say, \"Hey, I'm going to make it to where medicine can be imported from Canada and mess up Big Pharma.\" He was very intentional about what he said, and he stood on it, and he never backed away from it. And I've never seen a politician do that, which is the reason why I support him at that time. Was that 16 or 20? Both. Both. And I think that then after that, he kind of sold out to Biden, and that's a different story. Yeah, I agree. But he stood on what he was saying, and that's what we want to see from Kamala, right? Come out here and actually stand on something. And four years ago, you were saying that you were for Medicare for all, you're for a Green New Deal, you're for a lot of these different things. But we can't even debate you on policy because you won't stand on any. And I think what she's doing, I'm going to tell you the truth. I've studied Obama for many years, especially because I ran for mayor of Chicago and been in politics. So that was Obama's speechwriters yesterday. Obama's speechwriters wrote her speech. She never had spoken like that and really tied into her family stories like that before, and in length, and tying it into hope and change. That was an Obama speech, which remember, she went and got his crew to help her. And that's what this is about, is trying to run an Obama-like campaign. The difference is that people are not looking for symbolism as much as they was then, and they saw that that change didn't come after Obama. So now, is it going to work? It's not. I voted for Obama in 2008. Because we were in the, it's the Iraq War moment. Everybody was pissed. I didn't vote before. This is like the first real election I was in. And I'm seeing all of these protests. I'm seeing all of these, all this mainstream, all the corporate press. And corporate press was cheering it on. But then you had prominent musicians challenging it. You had Democrats challenging it. And then you had, Barack Obama was supposedly this anti-war guy. And then what does he do when he gets elected? You know, drone bombs. They call him a bomber. Things escalated. And I was not super involved. I was kind of just like, whatever, I don't know, I guess. And then I quickly was like, oh, they're lying. I voted for this guy and it was a lie. I should have known better. I mean, I've heard the stories. And I was like, I was 20 years old, I think. And that hope and change was all just nonsense. It was all nonsense. Now they're trying to say the same thing with Kamala. They're saying joy and hope. Joy? It's because she laughs for no reason. For real, like, they know it's a problem that she's got these videos where she just busts out laughing inappropriately. And then how do we spin this? Oh, it's because she's so joyful. She was asked a serious question about a war and started laughing. What are you talking about? People's health care. I mean, I feel like people don't clock it enough, but Kamala Harris has social anxiety. Like, if you watch her mannerisms, if you look at the way she busts out laughing for no reason, like, that is her coping with social anxiety. And if you look at, like, you've seen, I'm sure, her wild numbers when it comes to her staff turnover. If you look at the stories that a lot of her former staff have said, it's how she is so insecure about her own capabilities and how she's constantly in a panic. And if there was a big event or if there was a room she had to walk into with a lot of powerful people, she would make them rehearse, like, \"Okay, you pretend to be this prominent person and I'm going to walk in and talk to you.\" And then they would do it over and over again and she would freak out. Kamala Harris doesn't even want to be in this position. And honestly, I feel like if it wasn't for Barack Obama's influence and the fact that he would really be the president if she were to get elected, I don't even think Kamala would be running right now. She doesn't want that position. She just wants the title of that position and to let Obama do the work. Do you think that, you know, so her 2020 primary just fizzles out, crashes. Tulsi Gabbard really just nuked her campaign. Yeah, as she should. Is it then, do you think that she doesn't want to be in this position, but Biden comes to her and says, \"We need a woman of color for the diversity point, so be my VP\"? I don't think this was Biden's, none of this was about Biden. I think Biden wanted to stay in this position. Biden's ego and, you know, his family's ego, they didn't want to give up this power. But I mean, I mean, in 2020, do you think she was just chosen? Oh, 2020? Yeah. Oh, yes, for sure. Yes. I mean, we got to be honest, right? Democrats, both sides play identity politics in their own way, right? Democrats play identity politics to try to, you know, for their voters to try to get certain voters. Republicans play identity politics when they talk about folks are DEI hires and things of that sort. Everyone plays in their own way. And I think that, yes, if Kamala Harris was a white woman, she would not have been a vice president, you know, and we know that. But I think that he needed to add a black woman to the ticket because black voters, you know, did not really want Biden in 2020. Look at what happened in 2020. I was there. I watched it firsthand because I was with Bernie. Joe Biden didn't even win a state yet. And Pete Buttigieg won Iowa, right? Then Bernie started winning. He won New Hampshire. And what happened was, is Barack Obama made the call to everybody in the race. He said, listen, Pete Buttigieg is not going to beat Bernie. The only person that can beat him is Biden. Biden hadn't even won a state. And they made everyone drop out within 24 hours. Pete Buttigieg was doing better than Joe Biden. And they made him drop out to support Biden because they were that scared of Bernie, you know, leading the party far left. And so that's how Biden even got there. So folks didn't want to support Biden because they didn't want him. So he had to have a black woman to say that, you know, he had a younger person next to him that was black for his black voters to support him. Is Kamala Harris black? I was going to get into that. I was waiting on you to ask that. You know, the problem with Kamala Harris being black and people talking about this is that she never was shooting with us in the gym. Right. And I think I think that's that's the biggest problem. If you ask folks in the communities why Kamala isn't black, they'll say, well, she never really identified with us. She never really came around us to, you know, act like I'm black. And then when she ran for office, it was I'm the first Indian American and first one of Asian descent when she was running for office. So, you know, just because she went to a HBCU, you know, Rachel Doe is all there, too. The point is, is, you know, you can go to a HBCU or join a sorority, but people look at how you identify and people look at what you have been doing with black people over the years. And if you ain't been with us shooting in a gym night, why you want to shoot it with us now? And that's kind of how they look at it. It's funny because the Democrat view of this is, you know, she's got a darker complexion of some sort. She's got a history. Therefore, that's good enough. Right. And what you're saying is it's not even really about that. It's like, were you there with us? Right. Do you were you a part of this community? Yeah. Yeah. See, that's what annoys me is when she tries to act like she's the blackest person in the history of Alameda County. Right. When she goes around, she's like, oh, I made my collard greens in the tub. Nobody's eating your collard greens, especially if you're washing them in the tub. Like, let's be serious. It's like, that's how I know you're capping. But the thing is, it's like, is she a black woman? She I consider her black. She's Afro Caribbean woman. She is biracial. She's Jamaican. But is she African American? No. And I think that's where people get confused with the lineage. Yeah. Right. It's like, is she a descendant of African slaves who were brought here to America? No, no. But she is a black woman. It's just the way she selectively bounces back and forth with the race. It's like, can you blame her, though, at the same time? It's like in a world where identity politics is so important. I can't blame her necessarily for picking and choosing what she's going to identify with which heritage. But is it annoying? Is it weird? It is for sure. But I mean, why do we want to be so the question is, is are you black? Right. So then we've got to talk about what's what's the definition of black in America? What is the definition of a black American? And the reality is, is that she is she does not fit the definition of a black American, a black American where black was giving to Americans who were dropped over here. And basically we had our ancestors were in slavery. Right. So those that that lineage is the ones who got the black title, not Jamaicans, not any other ethnic group, because if you ask a Jamaican, they'll say, hello, I'm black. I'm Jamaican. If you ask a Haitian, I'm black. I'm Haitian. People have pride in where they where they're from. And so for her to say, I'm black, it's a slap in the face to a lot of black Americans, because black Americans who actually had descendants from slaves, slavery, know that Kamala doesn't. And that was the title that was given to them when they were dropped over here. Well, that's that's actually the line I've heard from a lot of people on the left about the white versus black thing. Yeah. Where you get this criticism from people who are white who say, how come you can't say white pride, but you can say black, Asian, Latino or whatever. And the left argues it's because you could say Irish pride, you could say British, you could say Italian. You have these countries, you have these ethnic backgrounds where you come from and you know your ancestry and you're proud of the culture of that country. Yeah. Black represents a group of people who are ripped from their ancestral culture. Correct. So they don't actually know necessarily where they came from. So they have that one unifier. Right. Which is why they're emotional when people say that they're black, because the struggle and the pain that actually comes with the fact that we were stripped from where we came from and we don't know where we're from. You know, most black folks, what we can see, what we trace is down south. That's the far furthest we can trace. Right. We can't trace over to Africa and the tribe of Cherokee. We from Zimbabwe. We can't trace that. Right. And that's why they've created ancestry and all these different things. So we were giving the black title because we didn't know where we're from. So that's why they're emotional about when people use it. Which is why I always thought that black was considered this huge umbrella where it's like they consider people who still live in Africa as black, too. And then you have people who are in the Caribbean who are called black. Because when people say that Kamala isn't black, it's like, OK, I asked him, do you think Rihanna's black? And they're like, well, yeah, Rihanna's black. She's with the culture. She gets it. I'm like, OK, well, she's from Barbados. She's not African American either. Is Nicki Minaj black? So it gets into this whole thing. And I know like Tariq Nasheed calls me a tether because my dad's side of the family is Haitian. But for at least three generations, they've been here in America. But when they found out that I had Haitian heritage, they're like, oh, you're not black. You're a tether. And a tether is basically somebody who pretends to have the struggles of black Americans, but they're not actually black Americans. I've even been called tether of the year, which I'm proud of that. Take every accomplishment you can get, I guess. But I don't know. I guess it just really comes down to what do you define as black? Are you only saying that black people are African Americans? Is that the case? I mean, I think it's both. Right. I think what happens is is is one lineage plays a part. Right. That's one. But if you are somebody who is black, but I mean, as far as like you say, you say you have black. Right. Or I mean, I consider myself fully black. But my dad said, no, I'm saying 80. OK, but your mom's side, she's a descendant. She has this. OK. All right. So you have the lineage. Right. Half of you. Right. And I think now it becomes on where do you identify? Because if you identify as a Haitian man, then you're not really with with the culture in America. You get I'm saying? So both of those things matter. The lineage and how do you really identify? Do you walk around and you operate as I'm Haitian or do you you walk around like I'm a black man and you, you know, in a black community with black friends? You know, so I think that black people look at both of those things. I think what you've had is you've had celebrities really shooting with us in the gym that they like. Oh, she black. You get kind of giving her a black card, basically a black or him a black card rather than than having a full lineage. Have you guys seen that? It's a super viral video where they put like seven black dudes and a white dude in a room with blindfolds on. Yeah. And they said figure out which guy isn't black. And this white dude, I guess he was from Compton. Yeah. And he was just like, they're not going to figure it out. He's like, they were like, we're voting for this guy. He's not black. They can't tell. And they vote these black guys out of the room thinking they're white. They're a white guy. And then they say, OK, we can end it now or keep going. And there's like four dudes left. And the white guy is just like, we keep going. They're never going to figure it out. Right. And he and he was like, because the way he talks, the things he's experienced, he was in jail. He like they see themselves in him. Yeah. And they can't even see him. So they just assumed he had to have been black. It's kind of crazy. Yeah. But I think it does get to the point, too, that your identity is largely your community. And Kamala Harris isn't a part of that. Right. So the media and me, I think it's actually Democrats. They everything is surface level. They don't get it. Right. And then when you actually look at a video like this, you understand that people are, you know, somewhat talking about skin color. Like, are you experiencing the same prejudices or whatever we might experience? But largely it's do you have the same life experience in terms of like where we come from, what we what we grew up with? And Kamala does not have that. And because that's important. Why is because we look at that because we know if you have that, you have more passion to actually do something about it when you have power. So when you look at someone and you see that they haven't experienced the things that you've experienced, but they out there saying I'm black, you know, it's kind of a slap in the face to us because they won't have the passion to change the things that we've actually experienced in our community. So that life experience, we look at that. Right. Because we know if you somebody like like Barack. Right. Barack was raised white. OK. He wasn't raised in the hood and the streets and had to prejudice. You know, he didn't experience all the things that I've experienced in my life. Right. So his his passion is a little bit different and power or how he viewed things. And so that that life experience matters a lot. See, I'm not going to lie, though. I do kind of hate that sentiment where it's like you have to be from the struggle. You had to come from have a deadbeat dad or be in the hood or go through all these different struggles or deal with racism your entire life in order to identify with your blackness. Like I don't equate blackness with struggle or with urban culture or with. And I'm not I'm not either. And I'm not saying you are, but it's like a lot of people do. And it's like when I was watching, I think the video is called Odd One Out with Jubilee. And I remember watching that. And it's like they're all thinking that he's black just because he's been through all these struggles. There are so many white people who deal with those exact same struggles. But then it's like if these white people identified and said that they identify with black culture, then they're going to be ripped to shreds, basically. So it's like I don't think that we should equate blackness with all these different. We should. But here's the difference. We want to elevate the community. Here's the difference. The difference is the piece that matters is the word that he just used, which is prejudice. Right. Like if you are a black person raised in privilege or raised in a white family that, you know, you don't have to experience what it what it feels like to go on a bank and get denied. Right. That's the red line in your community. Like you don't you don't know what it feels like to really go into the community and get profiled by a police officer because, you know, if you if you raise with a certain level of privilege, you are not going to be able to experience some of the things of just what being black feels like in certain spaces, too. Right. So it's not so much of the struggle in the hood, but what does it feels like feel like to be a black man in America, wherever you go, whether it be in finance, whether it be with the systems that play. And if you have not experienced those things either, then it's hard for us to know that you'll go in and change those things. Right. Because if my white mama, you know, always can cosign or get me into certain places, you know, like you can't experience that that real experience of being a black man, you know. But I wonder, though, are you just talking socioeconomic privilege? So if you're talking about just like being wealthy, I don't again, like I don't think being wealthy and coming from a silver spoon means that you are any less black. You just don't have that urban touch, I guess you could say necessarily, which again, I don't think is always a bad thing if we want to see more. It's not prosperous and to come up and write just, you know, come into. We always talk about we want to close the racial wealth gap. We want to see more black homeowners. We want to see black people thriving. Like I know I know you do it. So my kids, would you say that that makes them less black? No, no, no. Here's I'm not saying that don't make you less black. I'm not I'm not saying that makes you less black. My kids are growing up privileged, right? More privileged than I did. Right. They have everything that I didn't have. Right. That's they're supposed to. It's not what I'm saying, though. What I'm saying is that when we are electing people in power. Right. And this is more about folks who are are getting elected positions. Right. What black people look at is their experiences and how if we can judge to see if they would actually be passionate about these problems when they get in office. Right. And if they don't, if they come from a level of privilege, then how can we make sure that we're around them enough to move forward a plan that they'll adopt so that these decisions can be made? Because what's happening is Kamala don't have policy. Right. So if Kamala doesn't have policy, then now we judge him by if she black or not. Oh, you know, because personality. Right. It's just like, hey, because it'd be different if it was Michelle Obama, for example. Right. Black folks, they wouldn't question her blackness because they know she from Cabrini green. Right. They're questioning other things about Michelle. Hey, I get into that. We ain't doing that today. I've been seeing the right doing that. We don't get into that. I disagree with that totally now. Now, I do want to be Michelle Obama for a woman. To be clear, I mean, you know, if there was Michelle Obama, black people wouldn't be saying they were Michelle Obama can win this race without saying a policy. Why? Is because black people would feel that she's black enough for them, that she's experienced the struggle enough that she would care about it when she get in office. Part of the problem. So Candace Owens had this God is good clip. You guys remember this one? Which one? There's a clip where she was at. She was asked God is good. And then Candace goes, Amen. Shouldn't say all the time, all the time. Oh, and so you've you had the media come out like, oh, look at that. See, she's not black. She doesn't even know she's not from here. She got privileged. And it's fascinating to me that the liberal corporate media piles onto this because she didn't know to say all the time. Yeah. And that shows that you grew up privileged. But Kamala Harris, because she's aligned in their tribe, total past. She's always been black. Media says it's fine. How dare you ask? Right. But that's the demo. That's that's the media we're talking about. Right. We're talking about the media that has given her vast majority good coverage and vast majority bad coverage for Donald Trump. So we know that we know what's at play. And it's the power holders in the media that are trying to make sure that that Trump, you know, don't get back in. You're not for Trump, are you? No, I'm independent. So I'm straight down the middle. So, you know, folks will say that I say things that are right leaning and I say things that are left leaning. You know, I think that I think that as black people, we shouldn't be with any party. We've been on a Democrat plantation for so long and being promised so many different things and having gotten anything that we should be right down the middle. And I wish we had our own party because, you know, that will require unification because neither party represents our interests like they represent other groups' interests. So I don't believe in capping for either. I think you're I would call it Chicago conservative. Yeah. Chicago's only Democrat is Democrat for 100 years. And so I think you and I probably agree on a lot of things politically. They call me milquetoast fence or kind of middle of the road. But my view is I grew up in a city where Democrats have run everything and they've run it into the ground. Sure. And there's not there's never been an alternative. And so it's not that I'm conservative. It's I can just see like, hey, they keep doing the same thing over and over. It doesn't work and we need something else. Yes. No, you're exactly correct. I mean, look at the reign of Mike Madigan for 51 year, 50 plus years, Ed Burke for 50. You know, Chicago, people don't understand when you grow up in Chicago, you are growing up in the most corrupt state and city in the country. Every year they rate us the most corrupt people. People think that there is other cities that can match us. There isn't. And the amount of corruption that Chicago has with its politics, law firms, taxes, how all of the politicians tie all that in so that they can make millions of dollars off of our backs is utterly insane. And the power that they have to control all of politics in Illinois. So we being that we've seen that so many years, of course, we're like, hey, we got to get away from this. Yeah. You guys know about John Burge, right? Burge. Yeah, of course. A lot of people don't know this stuff. This is a guy who tortured largely black men in Chicago into false confessions with a cattle prod. Yep. That's at Chicago is a dark play. He died in twenty eighteen. Yep. Sure. Dude, Chicago is corrupt, man. Every corrupt. And it's not John. John Burge ain't the biggest one on this. He's one of the biggest because he has a lot of cases. There are a lot of other police officers just like John Burge who have, you know, used a home in square facility to torture people into confessions. And we pay millions of dollars out still to this day of people who are just being exonerated and getting out of jail. That's crazy. A lot of police officers back in the day, you know, they used to make people confess to crimes that they didn't commit and they'll sit in jail for 20 years. And then now we got to pay them twenty million dollars. Hundred and eighteen people, they say, were directly he Burge directly participated or implicitly approved the torture of at least one hundred and eighteen people in custody. And so the story was that he'd have a cattle prod and he would shock these innocent guys and confess. And that's a lot of these guys said absolutely refuse. They would say, no way. Torture me. I will never confess. I didn't do it. And then after a period of torture, some of these guys might get kicked out like, OK, we're not going to get it. Right. But a lot of these people were just like, please, please stop torturing. I'll say whatever you want. Yep. That's Chicago, Chicago. And the politicians were in on it. Right. So don't think that these folks are doing this, you know, and sound like like they're just doing this on their own. No, these folks are backed by the politicians. The politicians know police were on the streets taking drugs, taking money, giving, you know, put it in their pockets, patting the politicians pockets. The corruption runs wild in Chicago. And so when you've seen that is it's insane. Well, one thing I think is is is particularly important for a lot of people in this country, particularly on the right to understand is in Chicago. You guys obviously know about blockbusting and redlining. Yep. This stuff still goes on today. Today, today it still happens. It's illegal. But now it's a wink, wink and a nudge, nudge. So for those that are familiar, blockbusting. Holy. And this still goes on today. Yep. Let me tell you a story. I was I was in New York. This is twenty fourteen. I'm hanging out with this woke Hispanic woman, super woke. She her parents were immigrants. She was born here. And her dad succeeded, got wealthy. He bought a garage in New York and he gave it to her. It was it was entrusted to her or whatever. Right. I think it was worth half a million dollars. Yeah. And so she's talking about all this racist stuff in the country. And we got to talking about blockbusting, which for those who aren't familiar, let me just tell you the story and then I'll help you understand. And so I said, if a black family moved next door to your garage, would you sell? And she went, oh, yeah. And I was like, you know, isn't that racist? I was like and she was like, yeah, but the property value will go down. Right. And I'm like, so you're woke. We weren't saying woke at the time. I was like, you're a social you're for social justice. Right. You recognize these things are problems, but you'd participate. And she was like, I mean, I want to end it, but I can't lose my investment. Right. So blockbusting, this is crazy because it still happens today. But it still happens today. Yeah. What they do is they they would. And this was really big a long time ago. They go to a white neighborhood. A real estate developer would buy a house and move in a black family, give them a good price, be like, hey, we got this really nice house for you. And it's a nice family. Yeah. Then they'd go to the they'd knock on the doors and say, you see, we just moved in. Right. You better sell now. Otherwise it's too late. They'd convince these families to sell at a discount. Look, your house may be worth one hundred grand. We'll buy it for ninety five. Now, if you wait, it's going to be 80 because black people are moving in. Right. They sell the properties. Then the real estate companies evict the black family, own all the properties and sell them all the white families at a premium for like one hundred, one hundred and ten to make a profit. Yeah. They made it illegal. It still does happen. It's just a wink wink and a nudge nudge. Yep. And that redlining, of course, that's named after Chicago Southside, the red line. Yeah. Their real estate companies colluded to specifically make sure black people could only move into certain areas of the city. Yes. The important thing to understand is that only legally ended in the 80s. Yeah. So that's when the official like, hey, maybe it should be illegal for companies to do this to these people. Yeah. That means that there's some Gen Xer who was a teenager growing up in this in this reality where you have the market itself conspiring against you. Yeah. So there are a lot of conservatives who I think are good people and they hear this these narratives. This is why I really can't stand the woke far left, because these are real issues in this country. Real issues. A lot of people grew up with. Or if you're like a millennial, you grew up at the tail end of it. But still, your parents and the place you grew up was a was a was a product of these policies. And so you're naturally like, I don't trust this system. There have been bad things that have had my family. And only now are we starting to see the younger generations may have some kind of legal protection from it. But that means they're your grandparents. Your parents are telling you this happened to us and this is a bad thing. My problem with the woke is then they come up with this insane segregationist policy where they're like, we're going to have two different library rooms where only black people and white people can go. And I'm like, that's exactly what I'm pissed off about. Right. Yeah. I think I want you to Google J. Marl Green Chase Bank ban from Chase Bank because this redlining is important. Put in Chase Bank J. Marl Green. And so I'm banned from every Chase Bank in America because I fought Chase Bank just a few years ago on their redlining. They actually still to this day, I'm not fine. How do you redline folks put put J. A. M. A. L. Green Chase Bank ban. And so Chase Bank, we fought Chase Bank. Oh, this is you. Yeah. So we fought Chase Bank and we got them to give back a billion dollars to the city a few years ago. Right. And Chase Bank, you know, was we got the numbers back from all of the banks that were lending to urban neighborhoods. Chase were only lending to every neighborhood one point nine percent at a time. Remember, Chicago is the most segregated city. OK, wherever you go, if you see black people, it's a black neighborhood. You see white people. That's how it is. It's not not a lot of diverse neighborhoods in our city. OK. And so Chase Bank, when you looked at the numbers on the south and west sides, they were only lending one point nine percent at a time. So even in neighborhoods like Chatham, which the median income, you know, folks actually are making some money. They were given a million dollars over six years and the same a billion dollars to Linkin Park in that same time period. So you can see that they give away two or three loans in a prestigious black neighborhood, whatever, given hundreds of loans in white neighborhoods. And so we fought him. We start shutting down branches. And what we start doing is we start going in every branch, Chase Branch, putting everybody out, making them shut down the branch every single day and say, look, if you all don't want to lend and if you all want to red line urban neighborhoods, then you need to get these branches out of our communities. And so they're they're doing this recent history. Yeah, it's supposed to be legal and it's supposed to be illegal. But the CRA Act still allows them to have loopholes for them, for them to still got loopholes for them to have where they are still doing this legally and there's no repercussions for it. And then when you look at the city and you look at the politicians, Chase Bank still sponsoring everything. But y'all are not holding them accountable for the fact that they aren't giving loans to black people in the city of Chicago. That's crazy. So I'm just wondering, because I didn't know about blockbusting. And then with the redlining, does that have anything to do with credit and income? Like, is there a proportionality differences there? So here's the thing. When you're talking about a very small, just say one point nine percent of the time. Right. So that that that is, you know, for that to matter, that means that you would be saying that the majority of black people don't have good credit, don't have don't have no job, which is incorrect. Right. I'm not saying when you look at already, but I mean, when it can't you say the excuse lower? No, no. What I'm saying, what I'm saying is there are a lot of think of our parents. Right. My mom been at the post office 35 years. That generation all were given government jobs. They all had decent jobs, especially in Chicago, where they were working for CTA, post office, things of that sort. Right. So a lot of them always had the income. They didn't have the education and they had decent enough credit. They didn't have the education. So if if credit matters, of course. But when you look at the numbers, there's no way they can justify hundreds of thousands of of of black Chicagoans. And you're not giving one but one point one percent of them loans. You can't justify that. It's too many people. A lot of a lot of people in the chat are actually asking this, too. They're actually asking a similar question that may be credit. And these things skewers skewers lower. Right. And I do think that plays a role. Absolutely. But I will tell you this. I grew up on 49th and Laramie. Right. Just south of just north of Midway Airport, 47th Street. You cross that street. Everyone's black. Yeah. Just south of it. It's largely white, working class and Polish immigrants. We it was always just, hey, how come you cross this one street? Everyone's black. You cross one street. No black. Right. It's that's not an accident that when people seek to buy property, you're not going to get a loan for a certain. I just it's not an accident at all. If it were that there. So I know there's a lot of areas of Chicago that are like all black and there's a lot of areas that are all Latino, because people do like to live near people that speak the same language, that experience the same things that I get. Yeah. But if that were true, it would be more of a gradient. You'd see someone being like, well, I'd like to live near this neighborhood. The best house I could find is a couple blocks south. Right. And then you'd see a mix of people of different backgrounds. It's literally you cross the street. Yeah. And it was it was notorious in our neighborhood. Police would stop you if you were not black and crossed over. And then they would they would accuse you of trying to buy drugs. Right. As if going to this like working class black neighborhood meant you were looking for drugs. That's just how it was. Yeah. And we had I had kids in my neighborhood who might have known some of the guys over there. They cross the street and the cops would get in. We're driving you back. Right. Weird. It's just weird. And by all means, interpret that however you want. I don't know. I'm just saying that was my experience growing up on the South Side where you actually had these weird you cross the street and the race, the entire race feels that it's still like that today. I mean, if you come to Chicago, I implore everyone in the chat. Come to Chicago. Come to the actual neighborhoods. You go downtown. That's what everyone do. Come and actually come to the neighborhoods. You will see when you go into a certain neighborhood, you'll see what everyone looks like. You'll go into a different neighborhood. You'll see what everyone looks like. It's still like that today. And so we talked about the red line and the numbers showed even the neighborhoods where the median income for black people is 75,000, 80,000. The neighborhoods where people actually have decent income or decent credit, they still were not getting the same loan. So that's why Chase, what they did is they came to the table and said, Jaymar was right. And we're going to give a billion dollars back to Chicago. After I shut down their branches and I got banned and they banned me from every chase in America. But they knew that they were wrong because what was happening is they were intentionally then they'll say, oh, what about, maybe it's the values. They're not going to make money off the values. We shot, we showed the numbers showed, and this was a great report. Our name was Linda Ludden. She literally did a whole investigation to show, um, um, um, the, the other side to what everyone would be saying, even the default ratings, the default ratings were the same in black communities than it was in the white community. So everything showed that chase intentionally were red lining or South and West side to Chicago. And that's why Chase gave back a billion dollars. So what I, what I was told by this activist woman again, like 10 years ago was that she, she said, I don't think people are racist. I don't think the companies are racist. I think the presumption is the market is racist. And so this bank, you'll get a guy who's like, well, I don't really have a problem with this dude who came in. He's a black man. He's wearing a suit. He makes 60,000 a year. He wants to buy a house, but everyone here knows if he buys that property, our, our investments nearby are going to go down in value because everyone else is. Right. Right. And so that this, it is a big challenge, right? Obviously there's like, there's a lot of people, a sentiment is, you know, we're concerned about crime rates. We're concerned about poverty. We're concerned about these things. And well, my immediate response is, you know, Tommy Robinson said this on the show the other week that he does not like the extremist Islamic ideology, but when you get to, you know, targeting a single person because they have this religion, I've got a problem because everybody's different. Everybody's an individual and this is the issue. A guy who is not by any means racist will engage in a, in, in something that is detrimental to a community of people because he's concerned other people might be racist. It's this like weird self-fulfilling market problem. And yeah, I, I don't know ultimately how you solve a problem like this because in Chicago it, these things they tried enacting just made more racism. Yeah. And I was talking about this with we've talked about in the show when it comes to reparations. I'm like, if, if, in my neighborhood growing up in Chicago where it's, it's largely like it was Polish immigrants, it was white people and some Latinos you cross north of 47th, everyone's black. If the government came in and said, we're going to cut a check to this neighborhood just north of you, all the gangbangers from my side would have gone over there, just robbed everybody. And then, and then you're going to hear news reports of like white and Mexican guys robbing black people. It's like, I'm like giving people money based on race specifically isn't going to solve it. That's why I've always been more of a, yes, I recognize these things are problems, but maybe socioeconomic factors are the thing that should be targeted instead. Well, you know, and, and like, like you say, you talked about violence, what we're talking about, redlining plays into violence. People don't understand that going to the neighborhoods that have the lowest rate of violence in Chicago, majority of those folks own their homes, 75 plus percent in Lincoln park, 77%, right? Going to the neighborhoods where the lowest home ownership is, you will have the most violence. So you can look at the numbers and see that if you have a neighborhood where you have a lot of vacancies and you have a lot of majority of people don't own anything, you will have the most violence. And so redlining plays a part in that because if we make neighborhoods full of homeowners who give a damn about their blocks, right, who care about what's going on in their communities, you will have them holding accountable their politicians and holding accountable each other to say, Hey, this not happening over here because I own this and I'm raising my kids here and I want this school to be a certain way. We have to make sure that we empower people economically because that's the only way we can take control of our neighborhoods and not be waiting on a politician. I'm going to pull up this clip and we'll get a little bit more political in the domestic stuff. This is a clip that I saw the other day. I want to play for you guys. So here, check it out. We used to have stop and frisk for criminals in this country, but liberals whine. So now we only have it for soccer moms at the airport. So you like it when police stop and frisk black people, but you're angry when white women have to go through a metal detector. Got it. Can we turn the volume up? It was like super quiet. You got it. We used to have stop and frisk for criminals in this country, but liberals whine. So now we only have it for soccer moms at the airport. So you like it when police stop and frisk black people, but you're angry when white women have to go through a metal detector. Got it. And then he bites a Harris Waltz sugar cookie. So the criticism here is this guy says criminals stop and frisk for criminals. There's a lot to break down there. The other guy that says black people. And I saw this clip where it was a black political commentator who said, hey, yo, like black people and criminals are not synonymous. You can't just change the word there. And so this is what Democrats do. We had that study. I don't know if you guys are familiar with it. That said, Democrats, what do they call it? They pretend to be incompetent around black people and speak like they're stupid. Conservatives don't do that. Right. I'm curious your thoughts on something like this, this video and that phenomenon. I mean, that kind of leans into the whole thing of when they're dumbing down their rhetoric, when they're around black people. Let's say someone like Kamala Harris says that's Kamala Harris trying to show that she's black. It's like we were saying earlier. It's like a lot of people view you as not black enough if you don't come from the struggle. So for her to sound like she's from the struggle, she has to dumb down her rhetoric. So that's one of the many circular issues that's happening here. And then like looking at that video from like Date Right stuff and the reaction to it, it's one of those things where it first of all, I hate that they associate black with criminality. And it's the definition of I hate how a small percentage of the black community ruins the reputation for the rest of us because so many people try to just associate us with crime. They associate us with lowering the value of everything because we're destroying communities when most black people are not doing that. So it's like I have so... But don't you think it's a tad of racism there? Not just, you know, the folks that are, you know, the small percentage. It's a tad racism there for them to say, just like you said, automatically just associate black people with criminals. It's a tad of racism there. It is a tad of racism. At the same time, it's identifying patterns and stereotypes. And it's like black people are disproportionately doing a lot of these crimes. So that's why we get the allegations. But that's not true. I'm not saying it's fair, though. No, no, no. I'm not saying it's fair. I'm saying it's not true. Yeah. All right. So if you look at crime, crime is proximity, proximity violence. You go into a white neighborhood where everyone's poor, white people are committing lots of crimes too. Okay. So and if you look at numbers, white people commit a lot of majority of a lot of different crimes. And then people will say, well, there's more white people and black people, all this. But the point is, is that every group of people commit crimes depending on their environment. So it is not true to say that black people are committing, you know, a disproportionate amount of crimes. But then we're in their neighborhoods proximity wise. Yes, because they're in impoverished neighborhoods with other impoverished black people. So they're committing crimes against each other. That argument doesn't make sense to me, because of course, you're going to be committing crimes where you are, you're not about to catch a flight to commit a crime on black violence, it's proximity violence, you get I'm saying, it's still black on black violence, because it's two black people being violent to each other, that we don't say why don't white violence? Why don't white people kill each other all the time? We don't say why don't white people don't have this narrative put on them that they're being hunted down by other races, black people do. Because who's controlling the narrative? Not us. I blame white liberals, white liberals, yes, most of this stuff. So I'll give you an example. There's this video going viral right now, where a group of young black teenagers are following some 60 year old guy, right? They attack him, the guy flees, they start beating him up. And so the response from a lot of conservatives is, if it was the other way around, you'd have a national story, you'd have everyone kneeling at these events. And I'm like, that's not an issue of your average black person. Because you go to any sane, rational black person, they're going to condemn this, they're going to say this is nuts, right? And so the issue is white liberals propping up narratives of racism for black people instead. So when people complain, like, hey, how come we're not getting a conversation about the hate crime committed here? It's like, well, the corporate press is a bunch of white liberals that don't care. And they want to prop up the inverse narrative. But again, I stress like both you guys here would easily be like, oh, that's that's messed up. Why are they doing that? Sure. No, no sane person is happy with that. It's so profitable, pretending to be combating an issue. It's like when it comes to crime in Chicago, people don't realize crime is a billion dollar industry. And there's a reason why they're not doing anything to crack down on these crimes. In fact, I'm working on a whole mini doc right now about how gang violence is affecting these young children and how these soft on crime policies are have led to so many kids dying, like drive bys and a four year olds getting his hair cut, and he gets shot in the head, like these type of things are happening. And they know who's committing the crimes, they know what's happening there. But then more often than not, they don't want to do anything about it. Because again, it's more profitable, profitable to pretend like you're fighting the issue. Same thing in Los Angeles homelessness, they've put $5 billion over $5 billion in five years pretending to fight homelessness in LA. And there are more crackheads and meth heads on the street than ever before ever before. It's like a meth head safe haven out there, because they're pretending to fight these issues. They have these different temporary shelters. And I know this is a slightly different topic, but like they have these temporary shelters that are as much as $130,000 per bed, $700,000 per house and prime real estate. Why? Because they're pretending to fight homelessness, because they make more money pretending to than actually because that's a policy issue. That's politics. And I mean, that's what's happening here. These white liberals are pushing these narratives because they act like they're fighting racism, they act like they're doing such good work. And that's how they get back into their positions of power by pretending. So let's get into the politics of it. Do black people know how to get IDs? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Well, why do why do white liberals keep saying that it's race voter ID is racist because black people don't know how to get IDs? Like? Yeah, that makes no sense. For me, again, growing up in Chicago, I never experienced anybody of any race being like, I can't get an ID. Yeah, I don't. Yeah, that's that's new to me. That's news to me. Oh, you didn't hear about that whole thing? No. That was like the biggest story in like 2022. Right? Wow. They were saying that black people weren't capable of getting IDs. And now that's even why wasn't it like the MLB championships they even move something like that was some huge sport event that would have brought billions of dollars to a black area in Georgia where all these black businesses would have benefited. But they're like, Oh, well, they're trying to have voter ID. So we're going to move it to a predominantly white area. So these black people don't get the profit their businesses. Oh, wow. Yeah. So this, this is a video daily wires got up. I mean, Horowitz, this is one of the most famous videos. It's been reposted millions of times, it probably has 10s of millions of views, where Ami goes to, like Berkeley, and he asked these young progressives, is voter ID racist? And they say, Yeah. And he asked them why. And they say, Oh, you know, black people don't know where the DMV is. And they don't have the internet. So they can't get IDs. Then he goes, I think he goes to the Bronx or Harlem. And what I one of my favorite moments that basically goes viral, because not a single black person was like, I can't get an ID. They're all like, what, like, what kind of question is that? Of course, I know. My favorite point is when so one of these Berkeley liberals is like, they don't know where the DMV is. It's really hard. And so then he asks a guy, he's like, Hey, I got a question for you know where the DMV is. And the guy goes, Yeah, just go up here, you make a left on 25th Street, I'll be around the corner, as if he thought he was being asked for directions, not it was like some kind of interview. But this is one of the big, like this is in line with exactly with liberals presenting themselves as less competent. They create this narrative for each other, not for black people, not for minorities, it's for each other. So they can act like they're noble, and righteous. The funny thing about it is, conservatives. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's weird. There, there are people like right now in the chat saying, you know, we don't want to live around high crime areas. So we don't want to live around black people. And I'm like, it's racist to assume that you're going to get that I recognize they're talking about, you know, patterns or whatever it is, they're looking at a crimestat. But it's funny that on the left, they they will not, they there's that famous tweet from the riots during the summer of love, where the guy in Beverly Hills is cheering on the riots. And then all his tweets, like, yeah, get them, get them. And then like, a few hours later, it's like, stay away from my house. What are you doing? Help me know. They don't want to live near black people, right? They want to pretend like they actually care. And so they have this, like, weird, we're so noble and just kind of racism, right? And then you have on the right people being like, no, they have their own agency, they can do whatever they want. And it's, it's kind of weird that conservatives have this, I will treat you as I would treat anybody else. And for certain reasons, I don't want to be near you. And the liberals lie about it. But but like, pretend to not be racist. Yeah, but then act like they're two sides of the same coin. I mean, even when you look at like, look at the, the folks coming across the border, we say, Look, we have no space for them. Get them a room in your house. They like, No, we ain't got no room in our house. You know, so they always definitely hypocritical. They'll be out there fighting for them, but but they won't actually want to live next to them or then let a shelter come up in their neighborhood, or apartment building in a neighborhood full of them. Then they're gonna be at the Alderman office like, Oh, heck no, it's too much going on, you know, so I definitely, you know, feel where you're coming from. But I think they they both have their own, you know, they both are similar in their own ways. One just hides it. And one just upfront with it. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's like one is almost like, right, honest, honest about Hey, man, look, you do your thing, right? They're going to talk to you like they talk to anybody else. And then they're going to tell you exactly like, Look, I look at these crime stats. I don't want I don't want to live in this neighborhood. I don't want to live in a neighborhood with you. Right? Liberals are like, Oh, you're so you're so oppressed. That's so nice. Yeah, but you can't live near me, right? It's the virtue signaling. But so so let's, let's let's jump to the big question that I suppose is Trump actually winning over they say it every year, right? Oh, the Republicans are gaining among black voters. And there are some conservative commentators who are just like, shut up. That's not true. Right. He said every time you got these man in the street interviews, where you know, someone walks up to a black man, they're like, who you voting for? And like, I'm for Trump, right? Is that real? Or is that like selective editing? It's real. But here's the thing. It's real, but a lot of those people don't vote, right? So you got you got both sides, right? You got the sentiment, which is actually true in the neighborhoods. But those people ain't never voted before. So they won't make the impact that, you know, we're talking about because they really probably not gonna vote. But the sentiment is true, for sure. When you look at what has happened over the last 16 years, you know, Democrats have had it for 12, right? People are in a tough position right now. So it's kind of hard for Kamala to sit there and tell them that things are going well when they know that it isn't right. And Trump, you know, he had the four years that he had, and he had a couple years after COVID, where, you know, a lot of folks were making a lot of money from PPPs and SBA loans. And money was flowing, as we should know, right, in the neighborhoods like never before. And so then you had Joe Biden, where groceries are high, gas is high, and everyone's been broke, even if he had some money for the last few years. So people are going back to thinking about the time where they just the last time they had some money. And the last time they had some money was when Trump was in office, because after COVID, they had all those government resources. So that sentiment is still in the neighborhoods because throughout Joe Biden's term, everybody been broke. I mean, you hit the nail on the head. We're also just tired of our faces being played in. It's like, you can only lie to us so many times, you can only pretend like you're going to help us so many times. Because in 2020, I had just become a Trump supporter, like pretty much right before the election, essentially, and got red pilled that whole year. And I remember so vividly, because I used to support BLM, and Joe Biden talking so much about how he wanted to bring all this racial justice, and then next year comes around, and he won't answer a phone call. He won't talk to anybody. He's not doing anything in the black community. And black people remember that. And you can only try to win our votes over through culture and through rappers so many times before we start to see through it. Having make the stallion twerk is not going to bring no new votes. Did you like the twerk? No. I mean, I wasn't mad at it. I mean, it's like, yeah, we'll watch what entertaining like, it's fun. It's like, I would love to go have mimosas with Kamala Harris. She seems like she has a great personality. But it's like, that doesn't mean sarcastic there. But she is funny, though. We definitely would laugh. If we're gonna do anything, we're gonna laugh. But it's like, you can't keep doing that and not actually talking about policies or change or action. We want to see action. And one thing about Trump, he's gonna get things done. And whether you like what he says, you like his rhetoric or not, at least you know what's coming. Because it's like, I would rather have someone who's a little ignorant, maybe says some things here and there that might rub me the wrong way. But at least I know how you feel. I'd rather see you coming and see a wolf coming rather than a wolf in sheep's clothing like a lot of these leftists who are actually racist, but pretend not to be. So we're waking up to that very quickly as him being entertaining helps you support Trump. Of course. I mean, like I get into the antics and all of that. But like, when it comes down to it, I like his policies, not all of his policies. I think some of his policies are a little crazy. Like what? I am not a big fan of no tax on tips. I'm also not. Why? Because the thing is, it's if we're going to have no tax for if we're going to take, okay, first, let me go back. So if tips are a significant portion of your income, why are you not having to pay taxes on a significant portion of your income? And I still do. So my thing is, is you're going to be dropping the tax on tips, you should be just dropping the income taxes and everybody. I'm also not the biggest fan of the police immunity policy. I do feel like there needs to be assist. They need to restructure that whole thing where police officers are able to do their job. Because right now, police officers literally have their hands tied in a lot of these major cities. And I don't think he has a policy on that really, because police already technically have immunity. And then when they ask him about it, he's like, well, there's going to be a commission that looks at certain cases. And he don't even know what he's talking about on that. So I definitely think that him spewing that is a problem. So here's where I disagree with the tax on tips thing. I'm for it, but you are right. Because if they actually pass a law in Congress, Trump signs it, that says tips, gratuities will no longer be taxed. Here's the game plan. You want me to move your furniture for you? Oh, you know what? I do it at a discount. It's only 10 bucks for the whole day. Wink. Give me a good tip. But here's the thing. If it just means less taxes for the government, then I'm like, fine, sure, whatever. But it just means every job is going to move to a gratuity-based pay structure. Because like a furniture- It helps all of us. Yeah. It's like it's lowering taxes across. But you are right about that. No tax on tips means because the industry pays their staff through, I mean, it's socially required, basically. You can't not tip somebody. You'll get roasted. You'll get made fun of, the post on social media. So you have to do it, and they don't got to pay taxes on it? Well, I'm fine with no income tax. And I'm fine with that too. I'm not a super fan of all these taxes either, but would you rather raise a federal minimum wage instead and keep the taxes on tips? No. And minimum wage applying to waitresses and waiters in the food industry? Now waitresses and waiters, yes. Because when I learned about how a lot of them make a significantly lower amount- Correct. That's what I'm saying. That's kind of crazy. That's why they get tips. I would agree with that. Now, as far as just everybody's minimum wage- But you would agree for the minimum wage to apply to them now instead of not taxing their tips? Yes. Because tipping culture has gotten out of control. I got chased out of a restaurant once because- That's a left policy right there now. What does it say? Oh, I know. I have something. I didn't leave the cult of the left to just go be on the cult of the right and have no objectivity toward this that I have to say. But I got chased out of a restaurant once because I left a tip in cash on the table, but he didn't see the cash, and I wrote zero on the tip because it was all in cash. Now I know you're supposed to write cash. I didn't know that because I rarely ever- You're supposed to write cash? I had no idea that. So there's a wink-wink, nudge-nudge, always tip in cash because then the taxes is on them. Correct. But if you put a line through the tip section and then put a $20 bill underneath and they don't see it, they're going to run you down. They're going to come on and be like, \"Well, you ain't never ran me down.\" He literally sprinted out, and it was a nice restaurant too. I'm sitting there feeling bougie, feeling myself walking out, feeling good with my group of friends, and I covered the bill, so I'm really feeling like I just flexed a little bit. And he's screaming at me in front of all these people, and I'm like, \"The tip is on the table.\" Nah, you know what I would've done? I'd have been like, \"Hey, my guy, come with me.\" I'd walk up to the table, I'd point to the money, and I'd take it back. Take it back. Oh, I want to show you this. I'm a Karen. I'm a black Karen. His bills were immediately affected by that. That was his last shift. I hope you enjoyed that tip. Yeah. But you know something that's interesting too that you were talking about earlier is you feel like black people should be independent. I will say I can understand why black people have so many issues, especially in a city like Chicago with both sides of the aisle. And I feel like while there are, and going back to your original question too, while there are a lot more black people who are supporting Trump now, I do think a lot of them are supporting Trump in theory because they like what he has to say more, but I don't think that they're turning up to the polls as much as they should be. Correct. And honestly, I've been saying for a while, if Republicans really want to try to win, what they should do is stop trying to get, I mean, they should keep trying, so let me correct that rhetoric, but I feel like a more realistic goal for Republicans is not to get black people to vote Republican. It's to get black people just not to vote for Democrats. Because a lot of these black people are just like, \"Okay, well, I definitely don't like the Democrats, so I'm just not going to vote.\" So you're for suppression? That sounds suppression. I'm not saying I'm for it, but I'm saying that that's probably the smart strategy. It's the smart strategy to suppress a vote, you know, I'm against trying to suppress a vote. I'm not trying to suppress a vote, even though I do feel like you should have to pass a competency test. Well, wasn't there like a South Park episode or something? There was some comedy show where they were like, \"Just don't vote.\" And then they made the \"Don't Vote\" campaign, and they were like, \"We're never going to, I don't know if it was South Park or not, but they're like, \"We're never going to convince black people to vote for us, so let's just tell them voting is dumb and don't do it. It's not cool.\" See, I don't like that, but telling them- It's basically what you're saying, though. But I'm saying to educate them that voting for the left is not going to help you. It's like, I want them to vote for the right, but if you don't vote for the left and you don't vote at all, and that means the right has a better chance, then I'll tell you- What you want to do is you want them to vote Libertarian. Ain't nobody voting for Libertarian. Yeah, but to tell somebody not to vote is suppression, and we're against that. I mean, I'm just saying, but that's basically what you're saying. That's a bad strategy. No, I'm for it. I'm for suppression of the vote. So I think suppression is kind of a loaded term. I would say, I'd go to someone and say, do you know what you are voting for and who you are voting for? If the answer is no, you shouldn't vote. Well, I- I can agree with that. I disagree with that. It's like handing a loaded gun to a child. I think that more people should vote, and I think the problem is in this country and in cities all across this country is that people don't vote. So you look at these cities and states, a majority of people are not voting. The majority of people, the majority of all states and cities are not voting at all. We should be getting more people to vote because if you have more people voting, more of those people will actually vote the right way. I disagree. I think we need to start with more people need to be educated what they're voting for. Correct. Correct. So here- But I think the ones that know what they should be voting for neglect to vote. Agreed. Yes. Agreed. That's why I'm saying those people will decide the election. I got a proposal then. Go ahead. We want to universal mail-in voting. We want to make sure every single person gets their ballot right in the mail with their name on it. Very easy to fill out. And the ballot's blank. There's no names on it. It says city comptroller, city mayor, president, Congress, and you got to write the name in. That's it. So we encourage everybody to vote. Yeah. And if you don't know the name of the person you're voting for, then it's a blank space. Good luck. Have fun. I think you can't have these pre-made ballots where only the wealthiest and most lawyer-backed people can get their name on the ballot. Look at like RFK Jr. Right? That's true. They're taking his name off the off of the ballots. Had that problem in Chicago. And then it's a rigged game. If they're only going to put 10 names on and you're fighting to be one of those names, you can't win if you're not one. So no, no, no. Put out a ballot. Say mayor. It's a blank space and that's it. And then presidents, blank, Congress, blank, Senate, blank, comptroller or whatever, a state court sheriff, all that, all blank. And then it's up to the person running to make sure people know who they are more. Basically write my name on the ballot instead of a write-in, you know. So everyone's a write-in. Right. Everyone's a write-in. Because then we can say everybody should vote. Every single person. However, there's going to be a lot of people. And this is the problem I see. They're handed a universal mail-in ballot and they're like, I have no idea who any of these people are. And they go, just pick the one we want you to pick. And then it's not about the people who know what they want to fight for fighting for it. It's about the individual going door to door, effectively getting more votes for himself. So it never becomes a problem because we got a money problem. So unless we're going to overturn Citizens United and, you know, publicly fund campaigns, you're still going to have a problem because that means whoever's richer is going to get more votes because they'll have the money to get to more people. It's still true to this day. Whoever's got the money is going to get the votes. They can go on commercials, they can buy billboards. I think by taking names off the ballot, at the very least, activists doing door campaigns with their friends and through a grassroots effort will have a better chance of winning. Not in cities like Chicago. You know what I'm saying? So the problem is, as somebody who ran for mayor, you have to, one, have 12,500 signatures to even get on the ballot. That means you've got to have at least three times or you're going to get kicked off, right? So I was the youngest person to ever make the ballot in the city because of how hard it was and I got two challenges that I had to beat. And so, you know, you will get, in a city like Chicago, money rules everything. And so if you're running for office in Chicago, you don't have millions of dollars, you are going to lose it. When you're talking about grassroots in a very short period of time, if you don't have the money and infrastructure to get enough people to post, because you got to remember Chicago is a money town. Everybody's working in politics because of money. So if the people with money are hiring all the people that actually want to do something in politics, then the grassroots people who don't have money is going to be at a disadvantage. That's true no matter what. I got to be honest, I feel like- That's the thing with public finance and the campaigns. Everybody gets a certain amount of money and they can do what they want with it to uplift their campaign. Let everybody get a certain amount of money. I will say if we were to actually issue blank ballots where it's like, fill this out and send it back in, there's no names on it, your average congressional candidate would probably get like 3,000 votes. Oh, for sure. Microscopic. Most people wouldn't vote, yeah. Well, they wouldn't know who to vote for. They wouldn't know who to vote for, so that would stop them from voting. But I think that if you're going to do something like that, regardless if you do something like that or not, we need public financing of campaigns. Because when you have... It was crazy to me that the Democrats at the DNC the other day had Bernie Sanders come out and talk about how billionaires shouldn't be able to buy elections, then they have my governor come out right after him. Ragging about being a billionaire. Ragging about being a billionaire. He bought the election. He spent $400 million to be governor. 400 million with an M. 400. And so when you have somebody who's worth $4.5 million that can say, \"I want to be governor, I'm going to just spend $400 million,\" who's going to compete with that? It's not possible. On the surface, I think you're completely correct. The problem is the underbelly of what that system would get you. So who determines when the government gives someone funding for running for office? You get a certain amount of signatures? I mean, but that's what we could decide. That's how we could decide it. If you make the ballot right now, you have the highest ballot signature requirement in the country. We don't even need this many signatures to run for president. The Dailies did this. Back to the corruption of Chicago. You need 12,500 signatures in 90 days. And if you have one signature off, you get knocked off. So you have to go in with at least three times. If you ain't coming in with 30,000 signatures, you can't even run for mayor in Chicago. 30,000 in 90 days. Very hard to do. We can build that infrastructure. What do you think is a good amount of money publicly for a candidate to receive? If we said, \"We're going to do public funding of campaigns,\" what's a good baseline? It depends on the city. In Chicago, $2.5 million. How many people could get $2.5 million? You get 10 people, we're talking 25. If 100 people want to run, the city's dumping $250 million. But it's not going to happen because they're not going to be able to meet the requirement. If we have the same requirements, it is very hard to meet those, which is why you only have so many meet the requirements. So those people who meet the requirements, say, for example, usually in Chicago, you have five to nine people running for mayor, because you have to have infrastructure, a name, money. You have to have something to get that many signatures in 90 days, right? And so you meet those requirements, so you got five to nine people. They got a couple million dollars apiece. I mean, hey, everyone is on the same level playing field. Except the rich people can still spend money outside to win. No, we stop them. How? We put a law in place that stops them from spending. See, in Chicago, people don't know, we're the only city that allows unlimited funding for politicians. But here's the thing. Really? Yes, unlimited. It's impossible to stop someone from spending money in a way to benefit themselves. You can say, you can't spend more than, let's say you got a guy who's worth $200 million. And we're going to give everybody $2.5 million. This is the only money that can be spent for your campaigns for ads. They go, okay, SuperPAC. Then we go, okay, no, no, no, no. We're going to make SuperPACs illegal. SuperPACs can't exist. Then you're going to get someone in Indiana who's going to be like, okay, in Indiana, we will run commercials that bleed into Chicago, and we're going to make sure everybody in East Chicago or Gary or whatever is going to see this because we know you're still going to have someone. You know what we're going to do? We're going to fly airplanes over Chicago. I would rather have that than to have a situation where in nine people in a race, you only got a couple people with a few million and everybody else is broke. If everyone at least was lifted to a certain standard, it's about how they spend their money now. Because if they got a couple million dollars, and they spend a little on TV, they hire people in the neighborhood, people still won't know their name. Here's the other challenge. You know what's going to happen? Let's say Chicago says, we're on average five to nine. We're going to give out $2.5 million to everybody. Local television station manager is going to say, this is great. We got a guaranteed 25 million coming in every election cycle, raise the rates. It's free money. So we see this whenever a government does funding, like Kamala Harris is talking about this $25,000 grant, instantly, I see all these influencers, there's a couple of guys that I follow who are real estate developers and financial guys, not political at all. They put out these emergency videos being like, with this declaration, the moment she wins, prices are going to go way up. Because now, the expectation from the sellers is going to be, you got that money, the government's covering the cost. If the government's subsidizing this, I can raise my cost. That's not even my biggest problem with that policy. My biggest problem with that policy is that immigrants are actually going to get the majority share of that money, immigrant families. Oh, like in Oregon, right? Yeah. See, people got to understand the terms here. She talked about first generation homeowners. We got to know that it's more folks who come from an immigrant family that will apply to that first generation title than the folks who didn't have a mom or dad own a property in these communities. So the immigrant families will get the majority share of that money. And that's my problem with Democrat policies. My problem with Democrat policies is that they always try to be, say everyone can get access to a certain amount of funds, and then the folks at the bottom usually get the crumbs of it all. And then you have the black shills like Roland Martin say, \"Look, y'all, this is for black people.\" And it really ain't for black people. You get what I'm saying? So, you know, that is what kills me. And then black people think that these policies are going to really help them. When you look at the numbers, they don't, right? And black voters are the ones who put Democrats over the top. So I think that, you know, Kamala, what people are saying in the black community is we want a black agenda. You get what I'm saying? We need something for us. Every group of people get it. And when the Asian community was getting hate after COVID, they got an anti-Asian hate bill. When, you know, the Jewish lobby is the most powerful lobby, Palestinians, they go, I'm sure Kamala going to start to move over to their side a little bit to try to convince the Palestinian community. We, black people, give their vote away for symbolism and feelings each and every time. We got to stop doing that. What are you getting? That's why when they ask someone in the community, what's a Kamala policy? I don't know. I think Blair White said it best, that their whole platform now is saying that, or making up all these lies about the Republican platform and then turning them into these villains that they're coming to fight because they're the hero of their own Disney fairy tale. That's their whole thing now. That's that thing. And we got to stop that. We did that in Chicago. Now we have the worst mayor ever in Chicago. I mean, we constantly keep on playing into the symbolism. And then what do we get? Nothing. Well, so this is something that I find particularly interesting in Chicago. When you look at how Chicago voted, they vote by like neighborhood or whatever. It's all race. All race. Brandon Johnson went, voted for the Mexican guy. The only deviation was the majority white area with Loyola voted for Brandon Johnson. But this is crazy. Every majority black neighborhood, the top three candidates were all black. In the white neighborhoods, it was fairly mixed, but two white guys on top, Hispanic neighborhoods, two Hispanic guys on top. People were just voting based on race. They were voting based on race outside of Brandon Johnson because what the white liberal community in Chicago does is they find someone that can meet the identity of the rest of the South and West sides, and they find their guy that they can move their agenda through. And that's what Brandon Johnson was. He ends up pulling ahead largely because one neighborhood deviates, and it's the white liberals near Loyola, who it's a mostly white neighborhood, voted for Brandon Johnson. Yeah, because Brandon didn't get a black vote to get to the runoff. Black people didn't vote for Brandon Johnson to get to the runoff. They didn't know who he was. But once he got to the runoff with the white guy, it became black and white. And so all black people went for Brandon, and the white people went for Paul. And the black communities had the white liberals to side with them, and that's how they beat Paul out. And you think he's the worst mayor? I think he is by far one of the worst mayors Chicago has ever had. His IQ is very low. That's racist though, isn't it? No. It's the truth. They call Trump racist because he said Kamala was dumb. But I would disagree only somewhat slightly. I don't live there, so I don't know what it's like under Brandon. But I can just tell you that, man, all the mayors were just like corrupt, bad. Oh, they all were corrupt, for sure. But I think that every mayor in Chicago has been corrupt. That we know. The problem with Brandon is that his IQ is so low that he don't know how to be corrupt. So you just have like a shell guy up there that we're feeling sorry for because he don't know how to lead and run a city. He doesn't make any decisions. He just walk around and take pictures. So it's like you don't have a leader, right? And so usually every Chicago mayor has been a gangster. You know that, right? How did you not beat him? Well, you had the teachers union, and you had the unions all come together to put their money behind Brandon Johnson. And when you have all of that money at play, and the union's saying, \"No, we want Brandon,\" and then he gets to the runoff, then that's what you have, right? And so we got to stop playing these games. The unions run everything in Chicago, you know that. So once the union make their decision on who they're going to back, because Brandon was working for the teachers union, and the real mayor is Stacey Davis Gates. But that means that when you're running, you basically have to lie. Because if you told the truth and said, \"Look, sound policy is not going to be so good for this union or for this corporation, it's going to be some kind of compromise. We're going to have to enact a policy that you're not going to like all that much, but really we're trying our best,\" they're going to say, \"Nope, I'm not going to support you. We're going to get Brandon Johnson because he'll say whatever they want to hear.\" He'll say what they want to hear. And then you end up with, as you described, the lowest IQ mayor? The lowest IQ mayor the city has ever had. His approval rating is 27%. He hasn't even been mayor two years. So he has one of the, even Lori and Rahm, the last couple, their approval rating when they got beaten, Lori got beaten and Rahm left, was still higher than 27%. So for you to have a Chicago mayor at 27% at a year and a half, I'm telling you how people feel about him. Dude. And the migrant crisis is one of the biggest crisis too that's driving that as well. Yeah. I mean, it was wild. I went and visited family over the holidays, and it's all anybody's talking about. They've, schools being taken over, parks being taken over. And it was wild to see the black community in Chicago saying we are being replaced. Yes. And I'm like, I thought that was racist. You can't say that. It's the truth. It's the truth. Listen, we know that there is an agenda at stake, right? And when you have Chicago neighborhoods, right, let's look at the black communities. Just 10 years ago, Rahm shut down 51 schools, remember? You know, at all at one time. And he'd sent all of our kids to different rival communities, different schools to go to because he said that they couldn't afford to keep these 50 schools open. He shut all of those schools down, left them vacant for many years, right? We've had a couple of mayors since then. So now the community has been asking, we want these school buildings to be community centers, manufacturing hubs. Let's do something with these school buildings that are sitting here vacant in our community because what they do is they don't invest in our communities. They leave these buildings, you know, to go to shreds and they don't really care. They don't come and maintenance them. They don't never come back to them. And so the migrant crisis happens and the first thing that they do is go to them schools that we shut down 10 years ago and let's rebuild these schools and make them shelters and child care centers for the migrants. So people see like, oh, whoa, this school, we've been asking to do something for this school for all these years and you're going to give it to them. And then they look and see they're giving them child care, transportation every day. They're feeding them $125 million just to feed them. They're giving $17 per day per migrant. We don't even spend that in the schools. But you know why? You know why they're doing it? Because, you know, these people are like black people vote for us anyway, right? That's the problem. I mean, they take, they take our vote for granted. And what they're trying to do is they think that they're going to build this base, right? Of people by doing this, when really it's just going to bite them in the rear, in the end, because they're, they're usually more conservative. So you got to vote for Trump. No, I think that, I think that, uh, I'll stay independent. I'm going to withhold who I'm voting for, but what I will say, because now RFK is endorsing Trump today, right? Yeah. That's what they say. I mean, hopefully. Trump announced a special guest. He did. He did. You know, I like RFK. Um, you know, I like his stance on a lot of things from, you know, vaccines on down. He had, he had a lot of great independent stances that I agree with. Um, but what's going on in Chicago with the, with this crisis, um, is real. We're spending millions of dollars each and every day. We spent probably 20 million this week just because we were hiding them. You know, Chicago spent money to hide. Hiding? Yes. The whole goal for the DNC was to clean up downtown, clean up graffiti, remove all the homeless people, take all of the tens of thousands of migrants were taken care of and, and put them all in different neighborhoods and hide them for a week. So that when people come in, they don't have to see them. I wonder if they're going to do that in LA for the Olympics. Oh yes. Yes. It's what they do. It's what they do. I feel like the migrant crisis really is one of the main things that it's getting a lot of black people to stop supporting the left because it is wildly out of control. New York is insane. You know, 20% of their hotels and most of them, the luxury ones are just full of migrants. They're causing all this chaos on the street. My friend Emily was just doing a news hit out there and she was like trying to walk to our hotel. Police officer came up and told her like, you realize like pretty much everybody in this entire block is there was hundreds of people just walking around out there, all illegal immigrants who were just trying to figure out like either where they were staying or getting their resources. They come in busloads and just get out of the car and it's not even just the major cities. It's like these small rural towns too. So, my parents live in this really small town in Illinois and my mom, she's always been super, super far left and she told me she's at the point that she's about to get a shovel and build the wall herself. No, seriously. Every summer they just come in busloads. And this is to what you were saying earlier, there are a lot of black people who just will not say they're voting for Trump because my auntie told me I would never tell anybody but I'm voting for Trump. So, there's a lot of black people who just don't want to be shamed for voting for Trump but the reality is because they're watching what's going on with this crisis right now. You got veterans that are homeless. We got 20,000 homeless young people in Chicago. We got thousands of people. We got the highest unemployment rate of any metro area with an urban population right now, 6.4% of 100,000 people don't have jobs but we're spending millions of dollars each day, six months of free rent for them, right? The state has spent over 50 million in the last 18 months just to pay for their rent. We're feeding them each and every day, child care, transportation, the county is giving them free health care. When they see the incentives they're getting, they're getting stipends, okay? They're getting stipends each and every month. When you see the incentives that they're getting and you look at our communities that have been suffering and say, \"Goddamn, there's no team to enhance our lives,\" it's crazy. I think I know the play here. Democrats are spending tens of millions of dollars on these illegal immigrants. It's going to rack up to hundreds of millions of dollars. It's already at billions already. It's already at billions. There we go. It's already at billions. What's going to happen is, black voters and Trump voters are going to come together complaining about how all these non-citizens are getting money and the Democrats are going to be like, \"Well, maybe we shouldn't be giving money to these non-citizens. Let's compromise and do reparations.\" Then you're going to get all the Americans being like, \"I would rather American citizens get this money and investment than non-citizens.\" That's a good ... Hey, if that happens, that's good. We might as well have gotten reparations instead of spending these billions of dollars. It's kind of a funny thing. You go to a conservative and say, \"Should we pay reparations?\" They're going to be like, \"This is a bad idea. We shouldn't do it.\" What if your only choice was to either fund illegal immigrants or reparations? It's going to be like, \"Ugh.\" You're going to see that racism come in. They're going to call us the hardest R's you can think of because they're going to be like, \"You know what? The migrants ain't so bad.\" No, I disagree. I disagree. I think a majority will, but there'll be a few that'll be like, \"No, we don't want to give them no money.\" For sure. We had a guy on the show. I can't remember who it was, but my idea was it's supposed to be 40 acres and a mule. Is that what it was? Yeah. Well, the Bureau of Land Management owns how many tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions? I think it's hundreds of millions of acres or whatever. How many? What the number is. Take it off from the federal government. Give it to who I like. I would rather that we pay reparations in giving 40 acres from BLM, the governmental BLM, to BLM. You know what I'm saying? For sure. I would rather American citizens, even if it is based on race, I'm not a fan of doing it that way, but if it takes it from the federal government, I'm fine with it. Right. There you go. Compromise, everybody. All right. That sounds good. You would rather give reparations to the lineage of folks who have descendants of slavery in this country than to pay the money for illegal immigrants? Oh, me, for sure. All right. I'd love it. See, what I don't like about today doing reparations is that things have changed to a certain degree where you've got people of different racial backgrounds, and I think there's a risk of racial animosity if you are like, \"It's going to be race-based.\" If you said something like, \"It'll be based on the descendants of those who are enslaved,\" there's going to be some white, blonde-haired, blue-eyed guy who's going to be like, \"Actually, I do have a great, great, great grandmother, 2% black or whatever, 1%,\" and it's just like, I don't know. But it needs to be that way. The truth of the matter is that if you didn't have ancestors who actually have suffered, then how can you get reparations? Look at what happened with the Japanese. You go to Japan, it's beautiful out there. Who paid those reparations? Let's be serious. So we have to understand that every group of community that have actually been tortured and hurt in some way got repaired. Here's the problem. There's going to be a black guy who, fourth generation here in this country, turns out actually families were wealthy immigrants from, say, Jamaica or Nigeria or whatever, and he grew up poor because they moved here and then had hard times or whatever. That's unfortunate. And then there's going to be a white dude who's being like, \"Wow, I'm getting 40 acres. People are going to get pissed about that. No one's going to be happy with how that plays out.\" Yeah, but I don't think so. I think it would be a little bit different. You have a very small percentage. That's a very small percentage, right? Majority of those folks who have descendants of slaves would not have that problem. But I'll tell you this. Just outside of any of that argument, if right now we had the option to basically take all the land from the Bureau of Land Management, which why does the federal government just seize this property anyway, and we gave that to American citizens, that's great for the economy. Just do it. I don't care. It is. We're going to do something with it, right? We're going to build. We're going to build businesses. We're going to pour back into the economy. It's going to create new tax base, a new property tax base. When I ran for mayor, that was one of my policies, right? We got tens of thousands of lots and land out here. Why aren't we giving them incentives to build on it? You know, give them a tax freeze. It's 247.3 million acres controlled by the BLM. Yeah. That's insane. And it's largely in the West. And to be fair, a lot of this land is mountains you can't really do anything with. But I don't like the idea of the federal government just taking all of that land and controlling it. Like, nah. Look at Nevada, dude. Nevada's basically wholly owned by the federal government. That's problematic. And then we sit here and talk about, oh, let's not get rid of student loan debt or medical debt or all these different things where majority of black people have debt. But we can expend billions of dollars each day on this crisis, but we just don't want to get rid of debt. I mean, it's crazy. I've got to be honest. I'm sorry. Just real quick. Like, I can certainly understand, like, a moral issue someone might have with giving out resources from the government based on race and things like this. But I really don't see very many negatives to the positives for even someone who's particularly racist when you look at how much land the federal government owns and controls and does nothing with, to just be like, it's better off in the hands of private American citizens. And if it's the compromise, just do it. It weakens federal government, which is overbearing and much too powerful as it is. It may not result in grand flourishing cities or whoever, but I don't care. I don't understand why we just sit back and say the federal government deserves to own and control this land for no reason. Right. I think a land and a check need to come, for sure. Look, I'm all for defunding the federal government, but you know, I just feel like our country's in way too much debt to be giving money to immigrants. We're in way too much debt to be giving money to black people. We're like just for being black. We are in too much debt for any of this. Come on, man. Just for being black? Is that what the money for? That's not what the money for. Okay. Talking about slavery reparations, I feel like we are so far removed from that because I really just hate identity politics. It should have been happened. It should have been a long time ago. That don't mean now since it didn't happen when it should, we shouldn't do it. But the entire country now is in the systemic benefit of people of color, in my opinion now. It's a who? It's in the systemic benefit of people of color. Why? Because they put up black faces? Because there are so many different protocols that put black people in a position of privilege. I mean, look at the way that, like when it comes to the education system, when it comes to higher education, you have black women who are outpacing pretty much every demographic now when it comes to graduation rates and increasing the increase in getting degrees. Where's the racial wealth gap? The racial wealth gap? Yeah. Where's the racial wealth gap? I mean, there's still a deficit there, but I mean, it's certainly- Has it ever increased because of what you're talking about? I mean, it's getting better. There's like over 2 million black millionaires in America. Racial wealth gap is not getting better. But there are more black people who are becoming more prosperous, but it's like, you have to look at so many other factors because there's so many opportunities that are out there to be successful. What you're talking about are individuals who do, see- But what separates those individuals from the collective is the choices they make. No, no. Here's the thing. No, that's incorrect. I understand that. There are success stories. I'm one of them, right? And I'm one who can live in a prestigious community and give my kids privilege. That's not everyone. Everyone didn't have the opportunities and everyone didn't have the resources and the network and the people that I had, right? And I took advantage of those things to get to where I am. And the thing is, is we can't look at those few people like, \"Oh, well, we got somebody in the NBA and they made millions,\" and look at that as a way to make that an overarching message over the community that everyone can do it. Because we know everybody can't make the NBA. Everybody can't make the NFL. Everybody can't make a million dollars. But you can make middle class. You can make it to the middle class. But there has always been a black middle class. That's not the problem we're talking about. The problem we're talking about is really repairing the damage that has been done to these communities. And what's happened is, is you have so many folks in our communities that are still to this day experiencing the effects of slavery. And that's just the truth, whether it been all of the different, from slavery and the policies after it, okay? We can go on down the line from Jim Crow to the war on drugs to, I mean, let's go down the line on the different policies that came after slavery that they instituted, mass incarceration. And so they're still experiencing, look at when they talk about weed, right? Now states legalize it and now they want to decriminalize it. But there are still so many black men right now today who still have backgrounds of marijuana on them while white people are making billions of dollars on this drug. Now Kamala Harris put a lot of those guys in prison. Yeah, she did. She was a part of it. And she was against the legalization of cannabis. We got to start talking about this. We can't just act like, \"Oh, the damage is done.\" No, you have millions of families that were destroyed because of weed and now billions of dollars are being made by white people and black people ain't making a billion. So we got to understand. So that's the same with slavery. Damage was done. There's no repair. The war on drugs, damage was done. There's no repair. Mass incarceration, damage was done, there's no repair. And then now you have so many folks out here, they can't get jobs, can't get middle class jobs. And they, just because of all of the policies that were moved forward. We can't act like these things didn't happen because they did. See, I just don't think that's true anymore. I do think there's still, of course, there's always going to be a ripple effect because at the end of the day, it's a very critical part of our history and we're still a relatively young nation in the grand scheme of things. So are things perfect? No. I think reparations would have made sense a long time ago, but now we're at the point now where I just think identity politics are so unnecessary because just because something benefits a white person doesn't mean it won't benefit me. I think that we need to take the identity politics out and just figure out what is better for the greater good of society and for Americans across the board. But I'm not understanding where did reparation, you said that you were for reparations when? During the reconstruction era? Post slavery? As far as giving you an exact date, that's tricky. So all right. So you said that you were for that then. Now because they didn't do it, now what makes you feel like it shouldn't happen? I'm still not understanding. Because we're not even close to that position of disadvantage anymore. How? Let's look at the numbers. Or look at the racial wealth gap. Look at the opportunities. Or look at the homeownership rate. Look at all the different things. I mean, look at you. You've worked so hard to get to where you are and it's like, okay, you said you had other resources and connections of that nature and that's great. But the thing is, there are opportunities out there. You might have to work a little harder to get to it, but it's a socioeconomic thing at this point. It's not just a racial thing. Yes, there are more people of color who are disproportionately like in the lower working class when it comes to finances, but there are ways to work your ass off and get out of that now. Are we still being redlined? You are not directing that. Are we still being redlined today? Well, I'll be honest. Now I want to look more into it because I've had the belief for a while it wasn't as prominent as it seems. It is. It is. Still being redlined. I'll admit it. I'm going to look more into that now. When you see the problems from that era, we still have the same problems today. What I think you have is you're looking at success stories and you're looking at more black people in higher powers and you're looking at, because those are the people that they choose, select. You looking at the black people that are more successful today than they were back then, that still does not translate to the actual numbers of these communities when you look at the racial wealth gap, when you look at, and here we go, let's look at it. But can we also talk about the fact that with white people, it's like, who is paying the reparations? Because if we're just holding all white people accountable for slavery, that's crazy to me because first of all- Who's holding white people? Wait, wait, wait. To pay for the reparations? Who said white people? Why are we holding white people? Who said that? Why do we have to put a white race on white is- Well, I mean, that's what a lot of people say. Most white people aren't even descendants of slave owners. It was a very small percentage of white people who owned slaves back then. White people. So then if you are the descendant of a slave owner, you have to pay into the fund, which pays out only the descendants of slaves. Is that the way to do it? I mean, a lot of them are broke. Generational wealth usually, 70% of the time, it fails after two generations. But if you're also- so if you're a descendant of a union soldier who fought to end slavery, but a slave owner cancels it out, but if you're the descendant of a union soldier who fought to end slavery, then you are entitled as well. And if you're the descendant of a union soldier who died fighting, you should get some kind of veteran benefits for that conflict, right? I don't agree. I don't think that you should be held accountable for- No, no, no. It's not accountable. No, no, no. The federal government pays you if your ancestor was a union soldier. I mean, but even if- I don't know. I feel like that's so divisive, though, because it's like we're so far beyond the Civil War. It's like, I'm not about to sit here and hate on the Confederacy, like, as far as the people who fought in the Confederacy, because there were many other issues that were going along with that. Obviously, like, I agree with you. I agree. I'm kidding. But I think the issue I see is, well, if you go back to, let's say it's like 18, I don't know, 67, or it's well after that when things finally start winding down, Reconstruction goes on. Exactly. Let's say it was 1876, right? We had this commission. They were dueling electors. Not far long ago. Right. And you have, this is when they selected the president by committee because the tensions were about to burst into a second Civil War. Let's say at that moment, you are like, okay, we're going to end Reconstruction. We're going to pay out the reparations like we promised. When it should have been done. The problem now is the exponential growth of the descendants of those slaves. So if it was, we're going to give 40 acres to one person, now it's how many descendants has that one person created, 700? You're talking about the growth in the population, the family sizes, right? But I mean, I think that there's a structure, there's many folks who have put together great structures on how it needs to be done. And we we've studied it and put together these structures, you know, so many different times. Go ahead. Sorry, sorry. No, go ahead. I was going to say, how about Alaska? What about Alaska? What about Alaska? I mean, this is a lot of untouched land that is prime for development that the United States has that is not developing on. There's long, there's long, beautiful summers. It's not an icy, barren wasteland. The winters are dark and they're, and they're cold, but the summers are long and the fruit grows massive. You got a lot of land up there. And we had Jack Posobiec and Daniel Turner talking about Occupy Alaska, like we should invade Alaska, our own country. Stop going to these foreign wars. How about we give portions of Alaska in reparations and actually start developing the land we have where we can get oil, we can have more fuel for our country, and we can actually create new urban centers, new jobs and new industry in areas that we should be utilizing and aren't. Right. I mean, or would you rather keep giving billions to Israel, Ukraine, migrants? That's another thing to realize. I got to be sorry. I mean, let's be serious. That's a whole another conversation. Let's be fair. I mean, Israel. It's my choice. Sorry. If my choice was hundreds, hundreds of billions of Ukraine, hundreds of billions of Israel or reparations, I choose reparations every day of the week. Yeah. I mean, come on, let's be, we got, we need to pour into, and this is, you know, I don't, this is where I'm with the American first on this, right? Is we got to pour into America and American citizens. And what I do know is that if you pour into its citizens, they're going to make something out of it. They're going to build, they're going to create businesses, they're going to create tax revenue. And if we spent more money here and investing in each other and look at Tim and say, man, we love what you're doing. We need you to expand this. I want to pay for the expansion because we know what it'll do if you expand. We look at this landscape where we look at this business owner. We want to expand. We have to invest in its people. And if that means, Hey, let's utilize the resources that we have and, and, and you know, use it as a form of reparations to folks in, in, in America so that they can grow our economy. I'm for it all day. I'm going to read this. We got one comment. Hoyster says, had no idea Tim would entertain reparations. Wow. Let me, let me. I knew they was going to beat him up on that. I was like, Woo. Oh yeah. But let's, let's be logical about this. I mean, first of all, this, I have never been of the personality where it's like for some arbitrary tribalist reason, I will never entertain a circumstance. That's ridiculous. We've given what? Two hundred and some odd billion dollars to Ukraine. That doesn't benefit us in any way, in any way, our business. I don't, I don't like, uh, I'm not for operations and it's like a generalist, like we're going to do it. I don't think it works. I agree with what you were saying. We're well past this. However, that being said, if my only options were, yeah, give 200 billion to a country 8,000 or whatever miles away that is invading Russia and putting us on the brink of world war three, or we give $200 billion to descendants of slaves to invest in land and build businesses. I'm like, well, I think there'll be a lot of negatives that come with that in terms of racial animosity. That's true. But I got to tell you, we would be better off compared to what they're doing with that money. Now in a perfect world, I think we solve these problems in other ways. We don't go to war. We don't do this overt reparations thing. But if you're going to tell me that we're giving hundreds of billions of dollars to Israel, to Ukraine, and illegal immigrants, I'd rather American citizens have it in whatever circumstance that may be. So it really is like a big ask. It's a rock and a hard place. I don't think either are the ideal utopian outcome, but certainly one is better than the other. For sure. I can agree with that. You can agree with that? I can agree with that. All right. I love it. If it's between $100 billion going to Ukraine, which is not our business, we have no business being in Ukraine. No, you know, you're going to get your check and mule. I mean, look, if the reparations come, I'm going to cast the check. I don't support reparations. They're like, \"Well, are you going to cast a check?\" Hell yeah! Give it back! Give it back! Let me, let me, let me ask this of the viewers too. If there was a vote right now and it said every, every black American will vote for Donald Trump, 100% of them, it will. And Trump's promising to end the spending in Ukraine, end foreign intervention, bring our troops back, cuts, cut, cut all of our spending to Israel. But the black voters are like, \"But we do want a portion of that as reparations. Is that, is that an acceptable compromise?\" Woo! A Donald Trump victory. Trump would win. Trump would win. And so this is what I'm saying. In politics, you wish you could get everything you've asked for and more. Exactly. But if someone came to me and said, \"You have two choices. We're going to, we're funding Ukraine, who invaded the Kursk region, 130,000 Russian civilians have been evacuated, Russia has already threatened nuclear, nuclear weapons on numerous occasions, and we're not talking about ICBMs blowing up New York, we're talking about nuclear artillery and low yield bombs creating a, the first nuclear war. I mean, I, I, I understand World War II had nuclear bombs. It was two. It was the end of it. This will be the first full scale, ongoing nuclear conflict. Lord help us, we have to do everything to stop this.\" Right. If there, if Trump, if someone told me Trump's going to offer up that money that we sent to Ukraine to buy people for reparations and end the war overnight, deescalate the conflict, and he's going to win 100% of the black vote, I'd be like, send it in. Trump win. Take that money back. Give it to American citizens. It's not my ideal outcome. It's not what I would, what I would, what I would choose or plan for, but it is certainly the better of the two options. You know, another thing that, that, that Trump needs to do, since we brought up Trump, he needs to embrace reentry, re re reentry citizens. He need to embrace ex felons. Okay. Yeah. And I think, I think the problem he, he needs to understand this because the Democrats have this message in wrong, especially knowing that that majority of black people vote Democrat. They are out here loosely, you know, using the word felon, you know, basically me basically using it. Like if you were a felon, you're just nobody now, right? You have committed a life atrocity and you're going to be nothing for the rest of your life. And that's how they're using it in their messaging with Trump, knowing that a third of black men have felonies and majority of their voters are black. If Trump embraced ex felons, right. Um, and you know, he said, Hey, they should have their right to vote and we should be pouring putting jobs, uh, making sure that they can, they can have jobs so that the recidivism rate can decrease. If he creates a policy around that, he will secure another percentage of the black voters. You know, you know, Trump, Trump would also, if Trump said he was going to cut all funding to Israel, just not even Ukraine, just Israel, he'd win over all these lefties. Yup. They'd just be like, I don't like Trump at all, but okay, because some of these people, only that matters. I'm telling the Palestinians yesterday said they ain't voting now. They said that they, I seen some crying one said, I've never been so, I mean, I've seen one crying. I've never been so, so sad in my life. I think the Israel and the Ukraine situations are very different. I think we are sending an excessive amount of money to Israel and we need to be more like we need to be auditing what this money is actually going to, but I do think we have a huge stake in the game of what's happening in Israel right now compared to Ukraine. But I'm really happy you went there about the whole felon situation. Cause I was noticing that too, the entire DNC, they just can be like this felon, especially Elizabeth Warren. She's like this felon. You see neither Obama used the word once because they know neither Obama use the word better because you are degrading so many people who might've gotten a felony when they were 18, 19 and now they are in their forties, have a family and kids have completely turned their lives around, but then they can't get a government job. They can't do, they can't have, you want me to tell my children to vote for Kamala after you're talking about me like this. Exactly. Exactly. I'm surprised more people haven't called that out. So I'm glad you saw that too. Yeah. I mean, I think it's, it's utterly disgusting. And I, and I also think it's disgusting that, that, that Democrats are not doing enough to, um, say, Hey, we're doing great. Give us another chance rather than act like Trump started all of these issues. We've had all these issues before Trump and we need to hear some real tangibles. So we got to stop playing these fear tactics. You talk about project 2025, what's y'all project? What's y'all project? Y'all ain't giving us nothing. Can you tell us the policy? Cause Kamala's waiting until she gets an office, then she's going to tell us the policy. That's like not getting a job and not giving you my resume after. And I mean, it's, that's terrible. Um, we, we just have to do better as communities to hold accountable, um, you know, both sides, but I do think that Trump should embrace ex felons, right? Especially cause they using it against him. It actually can be strong for him because in certain States felons can vote. Um, and most black people have felons in their family, the vast majority. Right? Um, so I think he should embrace that, um, if he looks to try to get a percentage of the black vote. Um, and then I also think that we got to, uh, Democrats should push Democrats to move forward policy, real policy that is going to benefit their communities and stop playing games. I just find it funny how the number one thing missing from modern political discussions is actual policy. Yes. We talk so much about personality. We talk so much about charisma and likability and it really started with the Obama era because Obama was like your first celebrity style politician because I'll never forget being a kid and seeing him hanging out with Beyonce and Jay-Z. I thought he was the coolest person in the world. Didn't know a single thing about his policies. I just knew he was a black man and he hung out with Beyonce and Jay-Z. I was like, I like that. He inspired us all. I won first place in a world tour competition with his speech when I was a kid. Really? In Chicago. Yup. Yup. And then, then he hates me now. Who does? Obama. Obama. Does he? Well, I mean, listen. I was Rahm's biggest critic. He gave us Rahm Emanuel. Rahm Emanuel was his chief of staff in the White House and so I was Rahm's biggest critic and led all the protests at his house and things of that sort, but anyway, the point of his is- Did you beef him with Obama? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I did a press conference in front of Obama's house and said, \"Come get your roach. Let's talk about Rahm Emanuel.\" I was saying if you got rid of Rahm, he's the head roach in charge and the rest of the roach will go with him, but anyway, so the point is- So he doesn't like you. So yeah, he banned me from his events, but the reality is that I don't play into the whole symbolism. You inspired us with the hope and change when, just like you said, you voted for him, but we got nothing. And then, you know what he said when he got out of office? He said, \"Well, now that I'm out of office, I can do more,\" and he has yet to come to Chicago and say, \"How can I support Chicagoans? How can I talk about, make things better for impoverished neighborhoods and lower violence or youth?\" He's yet to do that. The only thing that he's done is he's built in this Obama Center that he didn't sign a community benefits agreement for that majority of the folks that he claimed that he was going to make sure black people had a piece of the billion dollar construction budget, and they don't, right? So all he's doing is saying, \"Well, I'm giving you all a presidential library,\" but he ain't came back to Chicago to do anything, and he's going to be a billionaire, first president that's a billionaire, and all he's doing is working on his Netflix and book deals. What did you guys think about when Trump spoke at the black journalist's event? I loved it. I ain't going to lie. I loved it. I think that, you know, for Trump to come into the fire like that, one, it was a real gangsta of him. Two, to go head to head with, what's her name, Kourtney? To go head to head with Kourtney, Kourtney Scott, isn't it? Go head to head with her like that. I think it was, you know, very bold of him in that environment. Most politicians come in and they try to play to their audience. He was his self, and I think that it was very funny to watch, and they had no substantial, no substantive questions. They're just like, \"Oh, so what do you have to say about being racist?\" Right, like- \"Would I be here if I was racist?\" What are you saying? Like, that's the thing? Like, all y'all talking about Project 2025, and y'all going to wait to the end and be like, \"Oh, oh, Project 2025, the time is up.\" Yeah. Okay. And that's not even his policy. I mean, that's crazy. Not even his policy. That is literally a recycled list that's just a compilation, basically, that Heritage put together, that has been out there since the beginning of time. It's basically just like, if you were to have the most conservative nation ever, this is what the guidelines would look like. And the reason why I agree with that is not based on, because they talk about his friends being on it. The reason why I agree with the fact that he's saying that he's not pushing Project 2025 is because I look at the four years of him being president, and the four years of him being president, he was very moderate. He was not as radical right as Project 2025. We got to be honest about that. They want to act like we didn't have four years of Trump. Four years of Trump was not, \"I'm a dictator, and I am radically right.\" And he actually governed very moderate on a lot of issues. Yeah, people try to say, \"You're going to lose all these rights under Trump.\" What rights did you lose when he was in office? He was there for four years. That's the tactics. Like you said, you sent them the good tactics that they got to use. Some of the commentary I heard was that people liked how Trump wasn't pandering to this group of black professionals by trying to, \"Oh, you're so right. I'm so sorry.\" He actually was like, \"Well, that was a rude question. I've never answered such a rude question before.\" He didn't care that she was a black woman. He did not care. Yeah. He was like, \"Don't talk to me like that.\" You know what? I think that they are running him as just, \"Be yourself, Trump.\" Yeah. It has worked for him to this point, and so that's why they're saying, \"Just go be yourself and don't be pandering.\" He ain't good at pandering. Donald Trump is emotional. He is. People don't believe it. You can trigger him, and you can get him to be pissed off very quickly. I loved it when he was talking, and he said he's asked about black jobs, and he's like, \"Many of the people in here may have black jobs,\" or something like that. The whole room was laughing. That being a controversy is crazy. That's true. But I mean, here's the thing. This is what's funny, though. What's funny is, let's remove this stuff about, \"Oh, it's black jobs. He shouldn't have said that because he white.\" Let's be real, okay? Black jobs is what he's talking about. People who, I just said, a third of people have felonies, right? Black men have felonies, a third of black men have felonies. If we know that these jobs in these communities are these essential jobs, and he's talking about them coming over the border to get those jobs, we know what he's talking about, and so we just got to be honest and stop playing into the, \"Oh, he shouldn't be saying that because if Kamala said it, y'all wouldn't have been mad.\" Right. I mean, come on. Let's be for real. So I tweeted, \"If Trump promised to cut all funding to Ukraine and Israel and foreign interventions, but he would use the money to pay reparations to descendants of slaves, would you support this? As of right now with 2,349 votes, 55% said fund war, no reparations, 45% says pay reparations and war.\" I think that's wild. I told you. My thing is, I think if reparations, our payment structure would generate animosity, it would make people angry with each other, it would inflame racial tensions. I think there's other ways to go about it. I think socioeconomic should, I mean, you look at the income chart that I pulled up. For whatever reason, anybody wants to say that Asians are on top, then white, then Hispanic, then black, and then Native American. Black and Native American are relatively comparable in their average income. If we did things by socioeconomic, this should satisfy the left because then you're targeting disproportionately black and Native American individuals with projects to revitalize neighborhoods, bring schools, whatever it may be. And then for the right, you're not doing it by race. It's not a race-based thing. It's going to help anybody even if you are white, so it shouldn't be that crazy. But that being said, I'm like, between the two, man, like end war. But I guess that's wild to me that people would say fund war. Because people, listen, there's a lot of white folks that want to give black folks no money now. We just got to be honest here, there's a little bit of racism there, and there's a little bit of white people feeling like black people are not going to be responsible with the money. They have this view of how black people are in America, and that's what they base it off of. I will add, too, though, there's a lot of people who want to fund Israel. And so they're going to be like, \"I don't care about anything else, give Israel the money.\" Yeah. And that's wild. Israel needs the money. No, that's wild. Would you rather, let's say it was just a million bucks, send that to the black community for reparations or to Israel for defense? Which is the priority in terms of expenditures? I mean, right now, in a time of war, I feel like it's\u2014 At any time. Well, give us both. I think it's different. If it was prior to October 7th, when they were just like, and the war's just exploding, then I would say that\u2014 We already giving Israel money then, too. We're just\u2014 And we were giving too much. I agree. Okay, so\u2014 I can agree on that. This is an increase of money because of the war, but we've always been giving Israel money. I can agree with giving Israel money. I think that we have given an excessive amount, considering they already have a lot of money, but I do think it's important for us to stand with them in a general sense, just because if Israel falls, we are so doomed. It's like, you have the collective Middle East coming after us, and then it's all of our problem. But this is why I ask, because you're not in favor of reparations to begin with. And so, right. So in terms of the poll, there's a lot of people who are like, \"Well, I don't like reparations at all, and I do want to fund Israel.\" So of course, they're going to say, \"Fund the war and no reparations.\" But I mean, what about Ukraine? What about\u2014 Ukraine's out of business. I mean, let's be serious. We fund everything. Talk about the military budget, okay? We got a thousand countries that we're sitting in. We spend a trillion dollars a year. I mean, let's be serious. If you're talking about, would you rather gut the military budget to give what we're talking about? Reparations? I would have to look deeper into what they're actually putting in that military budget, but I will say that whichever side you're looking at, our spending is out of control. It's like $29 trillion in debt. I really think that we need to be auditing the entire government. They're sitting here worried about our Venmo payments. I'm still not over that, but they want to just mismanage trillions of dollars at a time when I do think that they should be reinvesting in communities. Don't get me wrong. I'm not for reparations, but I am for elevating a lot of these communities, these socioeconomically challenged communities, not based on race, but just based on we should not have people living in a third world country in America. I think that's a problem in itself. So how do we do that? How do we bridge the racial wealth gap? I think there's a lot of factors that go into it. I think we need financial literacy. We need to, I mean, crime needs to be addressed, because one of the big issues starts with- How do we bridge the racial wealth gap? I mean, a lot of it- These are two separate things. I'm getting there, though, because when it comes to the, part of the racial wealth gap comes from we have so much crime in some areas- That's incorrect. It's the other way around. When you start with crime, you run opportunities out of the area, and then when you don't have opportunities, you don't have resources. Where there are poor people, there is crime, and that is white, black, and others. So what I'm saying to you is- It's a circular issue. So what I'm saying is, how do you bridge the racial wealth gap? Because if you bridge the racial wealth gap, you will have less crime in these black communities. So how do you bridge the racial wealth gap? Give me a couple things that we can do. I'm not focused on- Look at this. How do we bridge this? See, the thing is, I'm not focused on a race. I'm focused on elevating Americans, period. When you say bridge the racial wealth gap, it's like saying that you want to come up with specific solutions just for that race. Yeah, because it's a reason why the racial wealth gap is that large. It's a reason that banks are still redlining people today. It's a reason why government resources are given to certain individuals in their cities. Trust and believe, if we're talking about bridging a racial wealth gap, this wealth gap is not because of them in total. The government plays a part in that. I got some ideas. More cops in these areas. Infrastructure investment, parks, park revitalization. I'm not a big fan of the public school system. I think that's detrimental. We need school choice. School choice or something like that. We can debate school choice, but go ahead. Something like that. I'm just saying, I want to see infrastructure investment in the- What type of infrastructure investment? Closing the streets, fixing street lights, better access to first responders. How do we bridge the racial wealth gap by making sure people can create wealth in these communities? See, here's the problem. Here's the problem. Here's why I said those are the solutions. You can't just give someone money. This is why I don't think reparations. Opportunity too. Opportunity, but you need cultural investment. We can see this in any culture in the world. In the world, we can see it with lottery winners. If someone comes into big money, they lose it right away because they say wealth lasts three generations. Some guy, he's poor. He works really hard. He gets rich. He has a kid. That kid grows up rich and learns lessons from his father about working hard and maintains a little bit. Third kid, his dad never worked hard to build anything, so they can't maintain it properly. And then after three generations, the wealth starts to dwindle. We can't just go to a community of people based on race or whatever reason and be like, here's money. Here's this. That's totally different. We're talking about two different things. You can make that argument for reparations, but we're talking about bridging racial wealth. Right. So this is why my solution is we need to go into areas that are dealing with crime and we need to stop the crime, which is going to mean more funding for cops. We want to make sure the roads are cleaned. We want to make sure- It doesn't work. Well, then there's no answer. Then they'll say it's over-policing. It doesn't work. There's no answer. No. I'll tell you- You can't run a business in an area full of crime. I'll tell you what needs to happen. Okay? Number one, we've got to increase the home ownership rate. Okay? How do you do that? I mentioned earlier that if you find ... Going to neighborhoods with the highest home ownership rate is the lowest crime. The ones with the lowest home ownership rate is the highest crime. That could be inverse correlation. Nope. But here's the thing. What we have to do is we have to make it ... One, we've got to hold these banks accountable. That's number one because the banks who have branches all through these communities and the majority of the lion's share are money from these communities, they're not investing back into these communities. So we've got to hold banks accountable and make sure that they are actually investing in these communities. We have to give incentives to folks so that they can own homes en masse. We have to develop en masse as well. We have to develop ... When people see development, right, trust and believe. If you see ... If I build a brand new house on a block in an impoverished community, people know that something is happening. There's going to be a shift there. But there's a lot of challenges here. Property tax rates go up. Somebody who lives in an area where their house costs $100,000 and they're paying $1,300, $1,400 a year in taxes, you start putting in developments, the property value goes up and now they've got to pay $2,500. They don't have it. But the services get better, one, and actually it will even out at the end because you'll have more people pay taxes. Right. But the person who's making $25,000, $30,000 a year and struggling to get by cannot afford to pay the taxes on the property they own and so they have no choice but to sell and then go to another low income area. These things ... It's like a whack-a-mole. We do want to ... A rising tide lifts all ships. We can't just go for developments. I think one of the first things we need is stability. That's why I say funding for police. I think we get more cops and we bring in stability. We have more cops. Chicago has more cops per capita than any city. You got bad cops. You know this. But now you're talking about bad cops. So now we'll be debating this all along. The Chicago Police Department is ... That's what I'm saying. It's like a whack-a-mole. You've got all of these leaks in the system. Cops can't solve the problem. It won't happen. So how do you stop the crime then? You need better power. All right. Number one. Yes. But cops can't stop the problem. Number one, you need somebody who really understands the cities, right, and really can go into the trenches and create different programs that actually invest in people and grab these young people and make sure the next generation of young people are growing up. That's another thing. You got to make sure that the next generation of young people don't grow up to be like the young people that are committing the crimes, right? I think what we do is we target these people and be like, \"Police, go and arrest them. Go and arrest them.\" But then you got another generation that's going to come up and be the same way because we're not attacking the real problems, our education system, the environment that they're in. There's no trade in schools in Chicago. We're not giving them skills. So all you're doing is creating another breed because, like you said, crime pays, and it's a billion-dollar industry when violence is high. That's why they leave it this way and keep having the perpetrators come in and say, \"This is it.\" It's a school-to-prison pipeline right now. Correct. Culture is everything. It doesn't matter what your race is. It doesn't matter what your wealth is. It matters what the people around you are striving towards and what they believe in. Correct. We need a culture foundation, for sure. Where I grew up, everyone's in a gang. One dude was like, I don't know, he was 13. So the older guys in the gang said, \"Go kill this guy, and then you're in the gang, and you have no choice. You have to join the gang.\" So he did. They said, \"Don't worry, though. You'll get out when you're 18. If we do it, we go for life.\" So this is a problem of the culture in the area where I grew up, where there's a lot of gangs. You need to change that culture. It's not easy. But if you have a culture that tells people living that kind of life is a good thing, you're going to end up with people who do bad things. Correct. I think gang culture is really misunderstood, too, because a lot of people assume that you join a gang because you're a bad person, but a lot of times it's, one, they don't trust the police officers in that area, so who is protecting their community? The local gang that's there. They don't have enough opportunities that are in the area, so they don't have the vision of what they actually can be. So the two ways to make money, you can sell drugs, and to sell drugs, you're going to need protection, which is the gangs, or if you're a girl, you go be a stripper. But see, man, first thing I'll say is Chicago's notorious for this. There's neighborhoods that are controlled by gangs where you have no choice. You're in the gang or else. And so these 12-year-old boys are walking around, and the gang walks up and says, \"All right, you're 12, you're in the gang now, and you have to go shoot somebody. You have to do it, or else. You can't live here unless you're in the gang. They'll beat you up, they'll mess with your house. Everybody joins.\" It's a dynamic, it's that culture, it's a system, it's how they function, it's how they make money. However, I always tell the story because I love it so much, because there was a dude in my neighborhood who was selling pot, and there was this other black dude, and he was like, we were hanging out at the park, and he's just like, \"You selling dope, man?\" And he's like, \"You gotta make money, you know?\" And he's like, \"There's easier ways to make money than doing that.\" And he's like, \"What do you mean?\" He was making pretty good money selling pot, and then this dude told him how he went to, he called up the local, he looked at all the local venues to see what bands were playing, and then he'd get in contact with the bands and ask them if they had merch, and most of them did not. So he said, \"Here's what I'll do. I'm gonna make merch for you guys. I'm gonna come and I'm gonna sell it. I'm gonna give you 20% of everything I sell.\" And then these bands were like, \"Whoa, this is a great deal for us, free money.\" And he was like, \"I make like 1,000, 2,000 bucks a week working two days.\" And he's like, \"And then you wanna tell me the couple hundred bucks you're making slinging dope and you're gonna go to jail when they catch you?\" He's like, \"Have you even considered selling socks on the freeways? Like, get out of here, that's stupid.\" It's culture. People, they're surrounded by this, and they don't know how to do any of this stuff. And so some guy comes up to him and says, \"Hey, man, you got a bunch of dudes who smoke weed. You'll make a lot of money if you do this.\" And he's like, \"Well, I do need money.\" If only someone came up and said, \"Here's how you sell t-shirts instead,\" and you won't go to jail for it. - You have to rebuild the culture. And I think in black communities, a culture foundation is key. But again, that's why you must have leaders that are actually from the culture that have a connection with the culture. Because a lot of politicians, like in Chicago, Brandon isn't from Chicago, Laurie wasn't from Chicago. When you have individuals who don't understand these communities and not from them or never have lived there or never even been there, Brandon hasn't even been in the majority of Chicago communities, there's no way to really connect with these people, and those people don't look at you as a leader for them, right? And so we got to have more people that are elected in positions throughout cities that can go into these neighborhoods and start to help rebuild the cultural foundation and say, \"All right, hey, this is what we can do. Hey, I need you to know the different individuals who have actual leadership in these communities and utilize them.\" And I got some very radical policies that I'm not going to say, but the point is, is that we got to have some radical policies, but you only can do it if you really know these neighborhoods. - We're going to start wrapping things up. I'll give you my final thoughts. We got this chat from JC says, \"Weed is not dope, LMAO.\" Bro, to people who don't do any drugs, hot is dope. To people who smoke weed, dope is heroin. So for a guy who was selling t-shirts and said, \"Don't do drugs, don't do this,\" he called weed dope. - Right. - That was always how it was. And then everyone who smoked weed called heroin dope. So I don't think I'm going to get anywhere near solving any of these problems in the long run, but it is interesting what we're seeing dynamically with Trump. So if you want to give me your final thoughts before we wrap up and then shout something out. - Yeah, no, my final thoughts is, number one is we got to have some unity in America. And I think that a campaign season brings a lot of divisiveness. That's why I like standing in the middle. I got Republican friends, I got Democrat friends, I got people on every side of the aisle. And I think what brings us together is actually when we sit down and have conversations about life because everyone comes from different experiences. Everyone, you know, I come from a totally different experience than probably all of you, right? Which is why I see things differently. And I've experienced different things that you have, which is why I would want to do things differently. And if we sat down and understood each other and really talked and see why do I like Trump? Why do I like Kamala without vilifying each other and come into an agreement on what needs to happen, then I think we all can go down a better pathway. So I spend my life each and every day making sure folks can create generational wealth with my company, Generational Green, and helping them become homeowners, helping them become business owners, giving them incentives, pouring back into the neighborhood and empowering them. Because I know when I see someone own a home, they look at things differently. Because I know when I bought my first home in a prestigious community, I knew when people was throwing trash on the street, I was like, \"Whoa, whoa, hey, grab that. Make sure you clean up your dog poop.\" You know? Hey, I start coming outside on the porch to see what's going on in my community. And I like to see that mindset shift when people are empowered and actually have something. So that's how I spend my days. - Where can people find you? - People can find me @JMarlGreen on all social media, J-A-Y-M-A-L Green as a color. And you know, see y'all at my mansion. Right on. - Well, to keep it brief, I feel like one of the best things that's happening right now in the political discussions is even though we're still not talking enough about policy, people are finally becoming more comfortable asking questions and not being told what to think. And I think that's a good opportunity because for far too long, we were told that you have to think this way, you have to view things in this perspective. And now we're finally starting to realize we have a lot more to add to this conversation. So it's really important for us to be having this conversation. Someone might be left, I might be right, but we are not enemies. We are ultimately trying to look for the greater good of America. So that's what I hope things really come down to in this election and in the next coming years. - You can find me @Xavier, it's a regular spelling, it's X-A-V-I-A-E-R. That's on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and on Twitter, I'm @XavierD. - Right on. This has been fun. Ladies and gentlemen. - Let's do it again. - Absolutely. - Thanks so much for having me. - Yeah, right on. Smash the like button, subscribe to Tenant Media here on YouTube. We're back tonight at 8 p.m. over at youtube.com/TimCastIRL. You can follow me on @TimCast. Thanks for hanging out. We'll see y'all tonight. [BLANK_AUDIO]"

    "transcript": "A f*cking big d*ck! He crashed my interview, I'm crashing his. You got a nice ass. Appreciate you bro. They will break your heart and break you down, if you don't got the money. Bwah! Taylor Hanson, we're attending Media Day, I'm in Las Vegas, Nevada. I'm going to be asking folks, what do men look for in women, and what do women look for in men? Let's go find out. What do women look for in a man? A f*cking big d*ck! I'm not looking for a man. I'm not looking for a man. I'm not looking for a man. And then what do you guys think a man looks for in a woman? Big titties and a fat ass! What does a man look for in a woman? Looks and intelligence. So what do you think a woman looks for in a man? Looks and intelligence. Gotta be focused, you gotta go get that bag, that's what they want. Especially in this generation, no cap. What does a man look for in a woman? What we're looking for is understanding, comfort, no confrontation. And what do you think a woman is looking for in a man? Honest. Honest. What do you think? The honest ones, they're looking for some m*therf*cking money. But the fact is, what they need to be looking for is somebody that's a m*therf*cker that understands. No, you ain't, bro, they cap you. I'm keeping it buck with them. I told you, on top they're looking for some money. That's the end all be all. That's the end all be all. Right, but they ain't looking for that. If they was looking for that, I'd be married right now. Tinder Media, shouts out all the way from Chicago. Much respect. My guy, he didn't start it, he didn't ask the proper questions because we got an election coming up. He got a lot more sh*t he should be asking right now. You know what I mean? That was the last video. We respect everything, man. And today, I'm the first sh*t from Chicago. Shouts out Harvey, we voted for Trump. Facts. We're giving them sh*t some content right now. You know what I mean? No Kamala. What are you doing? Stop, because you was all on mine. Listen, it's looks and intelligence. That's what they're looking for. That's what men are looking for. If you're not intelligent, you're not focused, you're not going to go get that bag. You got to be smart about that sh*t, man. Alright, he crashed my interview, I'm crashing his. What does a woman look for in a man? Funny. Nice. Personality. What do you guys think men look for in women? Looks, hair, boobs. Looks and boobs? Yeah. I would also say personality. I was going to say tits. It's tits or ass. Tits or ass or both. You got nice eyes. Appreciate you, bro. You're welcome. Oh my god, stroke is gone. What does a man look for in a woman? I'll tell you. I got three things. What are they? Lefty, righty, and I cut around here a bit. Stop. That's disrespectful. Stop. A beautiful personality. You see those big brown eyes? Absolutely gorgeous. Hey, he's gassing you up over here. And she is the most caring person I've ever met in my life. And that is my favorite thing about her. So, those are my three things besides left, right, and back. Well, what do you think a woman looks for in a man? Security. Security. What does a woman look for in a man? A big wiener/good sex. And I think security, safety, and tallness. Tallness? Is that a word? Is tallness a word? It could be. It could be. It should be. Yeah. Height. Height. Tallness. Height. Same, same, but different. Same. For sure. But what do you think a man looks for in a woman? Oh, God. Men are so easy. I feel like it's, like, looks first, maybe good head on her shoulders, good family. And that's what they should look for. That's not what they do look for, but that's what they should look for. What do men look for in a woman? Personality. Personality? 100%. If they're good at craps, they can roll the dice. What do you think women look for in a man? Money. Money? Money. You think that's the main thing nowadays? Yeah. I think so. But all the girls I talk to-- Personality, $4? Yeah, 100%. What does a woman look for in a man? I think stability and honesty is the biggest thing, to be honest. Stability and honesty? I mean, looks really don't matter if you don't have stability and honesty there. And then just somebody that can bring what I bring to the table. If someone can't bring what I bring to the table, then it's just not worth the time. What do you think a man looks for in a woman? I think honesty, someone who's dependable and able to take care of the-- I guess the child-rearing part of that and building a family and everything. I'm very traditional in that sense, that I think that is a woman's job and what she should be doing. So I just generally think that a man is really looking for someone that can take care of his children and provide that role in a household. I would say loyalty, honesty. Being able to be in a partnership, you know, not one person being better than the other, just working together. Healthy forms of coping, willingness to change, effective communication. Not afraid of divine femininity, I guess. Someone to be your best friend, you know? What do you guys think a man looks for in a woman? Oh my god. It's hard. Honestly, a thousand things. They want a woman to still go to work but come back home and make their meals like they're their mom or just do everything for them. That's not what I'm about. What do you think? An object. Someone to just sexualize. Men really just do not be respecting women. Do you think that's what they're looking for, though? For someone to respect me? No, a man. Is that what a man is looking for in a woman? A man is looking for in a woman? Literally, an object. I feel like all men see is whole. Like tits and ass. You know? I don't know. What does a man look for in a woman? If you asked me to put what a man looks for in a woman, that'd be loyal. That'd be badass fuck. You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? They got to have that good-looking face, you know? They be crackheads in here, though. No crackheads allowed? No crackheads allowed. There's a lot of crackheads right here that are walking around with their circles. Nah, I'm cool with that. They want a photo with me, too. But my boy right here, my boy knows about love, expression, and everything. Hey, my boy! What does a man look for in a woman? What does a man look for in a woman? Oh, man. You know what? Just support and-- Man. [laughs] They don't look for support here. Support for real because, like, if I'm doing what I got to do, while taking care of a family, right? Man, I need support. Like, okay, I might come home late some days. I might have to sacrifice some family time, right? That's it. Just need that support. And trust. Trust. You know that ain't going to happen. That ain't going to happen. That's the question. No, no, no. Your question was what do we look for in a woman. Yep. Trust. That's what we look for. What do you look for in a woman? What do you look for in a woman, bro? Man, hold the mic. [clears throat] He's going to spit on me. Check it, homie. Tell the media, bro. Tell the media. First of all, I look for a girl to fly around my dickies. [laughs] Pro club. All that, homie. On top of that, look, she cooks for me. I don't want her to work. Oh. She don't work. She don't work around here. Real gentleman. I'm a truck driver, homie. All she got to do is just make the homie lunch and dinner all night. Lunch, I'm going to pay for it. Okay, okay. On top of that, I should take care of my kid. Yeah. The bitch that's taking care of him right now. I don't believe it. I don't believe her mind. I don't believe her mind. All right, baby. Dang, man. Hey, but listen. Hey, but we single today, though. We single anyway. I ain't a deadbeat, though. I pay for my kids. Even though they're not mine, I still pay for them dickhead's dickies. Hey, but you know I already know. Go support my boy tenant on media. You already know, man. He a big--he a big. You got kids? He going big right now. Go fuck your kids. I'll pay for it. I'll pay for that shit, too, bro. Hey, I'm going to take him up on that offer. He paying for kids. Woo! Hey, pay for kids. Anybody. All right. Yeah. Instagram. Holla at me. Hey, tenant me. Hey, I'm going to take you up on that offer, bro. I got a good lawyer. I got a good lawyer. Woo! All right, one more question for y'all. One more question. One more question. What does a woman look for in a man? Big dick. Big dick. No, no. I'm going to knock it down loose. Hey, women don't look for nothing in a man. They're just trying to look for it. If the man could provide, the man could, like, be productive with the family, man, or with the girlfriend or something. Trying to make money. They're just trying to look for it if the man could provide, the man could, like, be productive with the family, man, or with the girlfriend or something. Trying to see if you love them or not, you know what I'm saying? And I'm 100% with them. But if you're not fucking her right, nigga, she's going to cheat on you and she's going to fuck the neighbor, homie. I ain't come with the dirty shit. I was the neighbor, nigga. Hey, well, he right, though. He right, though. He ain't no nigga. Yeah, but. Hold on. Hey. Hey. Hey, somebody that can count on him. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey, what's up, yo? Hey, what are you doing? Hey, we need to interview you. Hey, hey, we need to interview you, my boy. Hey, hey, hey. Tenementio, go support him, man. Go support him, man. Hey, hey. Appreciate you, boy. Got the merch out here, too, man. Hey. You already know. All love and support for this, man. What are you in for, in the morning? It's my wife, bro. So isn't it? All right, man. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Wish for a loyal woman. A woman of God. Amen. A woman that isn't a whore. None of that. They're all fucking sluts. That's pretty much it. They're all fucking sluts. It's that simple. They're all sluts. Respect, for sure. Yeah. That's respect, for sure. Respect, wants a family. Easy. And what does a woman look for a guy? Modern day women, money. But real women that want to have traditional families and traditional roles, they want somebody to support them. That's the biggest thing. They want somebody that supports them, whether it's in their dreams, at their life at home. But if they're a real woman, they want kids, in my opinion. A real woman should want kids, and they should want to raise kids. But they need a man in the house that can support them, so they don't have to work. And listen. And listen. You have a good man. No, but listen. Listen, boss. What does a woman look for in a man? Money. Big dick. Those two, they need to coincide? Yeah. 100%. Can you sacrifice the big dick if they have a lot of money? No. No. No? No. No. Because he's going to want to have sex. So you have to, I mean, you got to have both. What do you guys think a man looks for in a woman? That booty. Booty. Body. Booty. Booty. Do you think those three coincide often? No. No. No? No. Yeah. They want the booty. That's the main thing? Yeah. Booty. What do you think a man looks for in a woman? Jamming the mic. My ass and titties, though. You think that's it? Yep. What does a man look for in a woman? Everything he's not. All the girls he don't find. Gladiators. Qualities, what would you say? She has to match my pace. You got to be a breadwinner? She can't be a broke chick, though. She got to have money. Money. Money. Money. Money. She got to have money. Straight up. What does a man look for in a woman? Good personality. I mean, someone that's not a cheater. Loyal. That loyalty. That's the biggest thing in your mind? Biggest thing, yeah. And then what do you think a woman looks for in a man? Everything. Provide for them, to be there by their side, not to cheat on them, and be like that. What does a man look for in a woman? Dance. Is that it? That's it. All right. What do you think a woman is looking for in a man? A good father. What does a woman look for in a man? Humor. Humor. Yeah. Is that a big one? That's a huge one. If you can't make me lift this up. What do you think a man is looking for in a woman? Looks. And lipstick. What does a woman look for in a man? Stability. What do you think men look for in women? Somebody who can support them. What does a man look for in a woman? Loyalty. That's the biggest one? Respect, probably. Because with respect, there's loyalty. What do you think a woman looks for in a man? If he can provide for her. Emotionally and physically. What does a woman look for in a man? A big truck. Big truck? You got a big truck, bro? I used to. We're brother and sister. So you don't want a big truck right now. That might be weird. What do you think a man is looking for in a woman? Big titties. What does a woman look for in a man? You have to be really smart and respectful of my boundaries. You have to be polite, funny, kind. I think it's a plus too, I don't know. What do you guys think a man is looking for in a woman? Someone nurturing and attentive. Somebody to have sex with. Somebody independent and smart as well. What does a woman look for in a man? Respect. That's the biggest one? I think so, yeah. What do you think a man looks for in a woman? Body. Number one? I think so, yeah. What does a man look for in a woman? Money. Loyalty and consistency. I am, yeah, I'm one of them, y'all. The lover boy. Hey, reporting live from Las Vegas but straight out of Oxnard. Remember that. What do you guys think a woman looks for in a man? Money. Listen, they don't care about the bag. They don't care about the heart. They'll break that shit. They'll break that shit. Listen, they don't care about nothing but the money. What about you, bro? Nothing but the money, though. I will say that, yes. They will break your heart and break you down if you don't got the money. What does a woman look for in a man? Honesty and loyalty. You think those are the biggest ones? Yeah. And then what do you think a man looks for in a woman? I think the same and, like, peace. No one crazy that's not going to disturb the household, make their life harder. I don't think nobody looks for that. What does a man look for in a woman? Me, the brains. I don't know about all men, but all men look for luck. She got a fat ass. She got nice tits. That's what they're looking for tonight. Tomorrow, you're done with that, right? Go back to the real world. She ain't what you thought she was when you looked at it that night. It's over. Any man should be able to settle down with it, be able to hold it down? Any man should. But if you're looking for the one night-- Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. If you're looking for the one night, that ain't going to work for you because that's all you're going to get out of her. A real man should look for the brains of the female, not how she look. What do you think a woman is looking for in a man? If I had to be honest, the biggest schlong. I say the biggest schlong. But if he don't got the biggest schlong, I don't know what else she might see in him. Maybe money, money. Money and big schlong? Money or--one of the two. It can't be the brains because that's all we want. They don't look for the brains in us. They're looking for the schlong or you got the money. What does a man look for in a woman? Oh, sh--. They want to be the woman to be all nice and neat in the streets. But when we get home, you know that shit. Not a hoe? Not a hoe in the streets but a freak in the sheets. That's exactly what the hell we want. Any man to that. I promise you. Every man will vouch for that. I promise you. Act like a lady in the streets while we're out and about. Have a little sense to yourself. But when we get home, put that shit on. Fucking be like, \"Call me daddy.\" Let me spank that ass. Come on. What do you think a woman is looking for in a man? Oh, sh--. A woman wants--like, every woman wants security. All right? Like, they want security. Like, you ain't got to be a tough ass, but they want a man that knows when she goes out, she's protected. She's protected, she's wanted. Let her do her thing but also in a fight, like, she knows that, like, no matter what, her man got her back. That's what everyone wants. Just be wanted and protected. What does a man look for in a woman? Honestly, humor. I like a girl that can make me laugh. If a girl can make me laugh, she want me over 90%, but like a real laugh, you know? Like the laugh that you go with your homies. Charisma. Charisma, yeah. Yeah, that's the main thing. Honestly, making me laugh and a good personality, you know? Like, you know, she's got humor, she's loyal, and that she got your back is important for me. Then what do you think a woman is looking for in a man? I feel like somebody she can respect, you know? Somebody that she really respects, that she can look up to, like, say, \"Oh, wow, I can attain that.\" Someone who's ambitious, who has goals, who's doing things with his life, you know? The more complete you are as a man, the more girls will be like, \"Wow, I respect that.\" Yeah, someone that can take care about her in everything. Taylor Hansen, Will Smith, shout-out Tenet Media.

    "transcript": "(upbeat music) - What's up boys, how we doing tonight? We are live once again for the final night of the DNC convention. We've just been live streaming through the DNC and I came home and I said, wow, these people need some Tic Tacs. I need to do a collection at church and get these people some breath mints. They smelled like cheese that had been left on the back of a pack mule riding through the Himalayas on a very hot day. Unfortunately, I had to stand there with Vivek holding a camera. I know some of you might've been tuning in. With that camera, we captured some very special things but nothing as special as our special guest today. The governor of Illinois, Rod Blagojevich in the studio, in the arena. God bless you, sir. Thank you for being with us. - Thank you, Benny, for having me. Thank you for the great work you're doing out there. - I would have loved to have had you with us at the DNC. I feel like you could have been a Sherpa, a sensei. You could have like brought us, you know, kind of around. You know that, you know, you've hit those bricks before. - Well, yeah, and I know that neighborhood real well 'cause I was raised in the city of Chicago, not too far from there. And I could have been helpful to you because, you know, I probably have a few friends left at the Democratic Party. Like maybe three. - Yeah, that's right, okay. You were the kingmaker in that party. - I don't know if I was the kingmaker, but I was sort of like the king of the jungle for a little while. Six years when I was the governor, twice elected. And looking back and how that ended, I kind of wish I never was the governor, twice elected. - Oh God, well, all right, fine, fine. I'll say it, I'll say it. My family came in, I'll say it. My family would travel here all the time. And when you were governor, the state was run really, really well. Chicago was, I think, in a much better place. I love this city. It's a great American city, but it breaks my heart walking on Michigan Avenue and seeing like half the storefronts empty. - Yeah, no, that's a great point. Thank you for saying that, by the way. And just real quick to get this out of the way to your listeners, I didn't do it. I didn't raise your taxes on your parents when they lived in the Quad Cities. And I didn't do the other thing that sent me to prison for eight years. These were conversations that began by then-president-elect Obama. And he goes to the White House for eight years and I go to the shithouse for eight years. Can I say that here? - Sure. - Yeah, and- - We're streaming. - I think it's fair to say that Obama had a better eight years than me. But anyway, I fought back. And anyway, the rest is history. But as is written in Genesis chapter 50, what they meant for evil, God meant for good. And I really think some good will come out of it. I got a chance to meet you and I got a chance to get to know President Trump on \"Celebrity Apprentice.\" He fired me on that show and he was right to do it. And then he freed me from prison and he was right to do that. He's the only president in American history to have fired and freed the same guy. Even Lincoln didn't do that. - Really? Okay. Well, hey, listen, we're in Trump Tower right now. This was being built during your governorship. Am I wrong? While you were governor, this was being built, this beautiful building. - Yeah, he was getting it started right about that time. And it wasn't done when I had to go to, they call it college, when I had the shelter in place for those eight years. But when I came back, it's magnificent. And, you know, I have such a personal fondness and appreciation to President Trump, what he did for me. And I don't mean to be flippant about this, I really do. That whenever I'm in one of his hotels and they're all the highest quality, you know that. - They are. - I had to just use the men's room before we came in. And I'm so careful with his stuff that after I washed my hands, I splashed some water on the sink. I took some towels and wiped it off. I'm gonna make sure I took care of his stuff 'cause I owe him so much. - Okay, well, I think that we're gonna have a rowdy conversation tonight. Inside of the DNC, there was quite an interesting vibe, very strange, I get very strange. And maybe you can talk me through it because I've been to democratic conventions to cover them, right? For various outfits I worked for when I was working for different journalism outfits. However, what I saw tonight was not joy. Everyone's talking about how joyful everything is. What I saw tonight was not joy. It was very strange, very macabre. I was yelled at a couple of times. People were very salty, but I didn't see a single Biden button. I didn't see a single Biden shirt. I didn't see a single Biden mention. You'd think there'd be something like a photo or a doodad or a knickknack about Joe Biden. The guy's technically still president. Nothing, baby. I mean, they'd cleaned house like he never existed. I was like, man, that's brutal. - Yeah, well, think about how they pushed him out. It was a backroom deal with Obama and Pelosi leading the charge in the old Chicago machine way. They looked different than the old Chicago ward bosses. And the last time I saw Obama, he wasn't wearing a pinky ring, but they act the same way and they pressured him and did what they did and they got him to step out. It was almost like they forced him. They forced the president of the United States and the guy who got 14 million votes from Democratic primary voters. It's almost like they forced him to have that vasectomy they're offering over at this convention. They emasculated him. And the fact that he gave up and gave into that is really disappointing. I mean, stand up for yourself. And how about standing up for those 14 million Democratic voters who voted for you? Don't let those two push you out. - Yeah, but he did. - He did, and that's how they treat him now. And that's how bullies treat people who aren't strong and tough. In any event, that's what happened. It's kind of sad in some respects, but Biden has been a career politician his whole life. He's been in Washington since 1973. Think about that. He was elected to the Senate when he just barely turned 30 years old. And he's been a creature of that Washington establishment for, what is that? 50 years or so, 52 years. - They got his number. - They got his number, and he plays for them. He doesn't play for the people. You see, that's the problem with politics today and government today. Most of them are establishment figures in both parties. The Trump Republican Party is very different now, and that's why they're making so much noise. But for the most part, they make their deals. Democrats make their deals with congressmen like Kinzinger. Did he speak yet, by the way, at the convention? - I'm not sure. Let's pop up just kind of like a, we just pop up the preview of the convention. Let's have a look here. What do we got? An actress, right? - A lot like mine, and I'm sure a lot like yours. - Got an actress up here, Eva Longoria? Is this Eva Longoria? - Looks like her. - Anything. - All right, okay. - Especially as women. - Well, my question about Kinzinger is, if he spoke tonight, I wonder if he cried. - Yeah. Did he cry? I don't know. - He tends to be fast and loose with those tears. - You know how to dirt on everyone in this state. - Well, I mean, I know a lot of people here because, well, I was the governor. - Yeah. - But yeah, in any event, it's kind of unfortunate with how they're treating Biden. But again, it goes back to the fact that it was never about the people with him. It was all about the Washington insiders that he spent his whole life with. And when they told him it was time to step out, he basically gave a nephew to those 14 million Democratic working people who voted for him. Their votes didn't matter to him. The voices of Obama and Pelosi and the bosses and the donors and a few movie stars was more important to Biden, so he stepped out. What a wimp. - What a wimp. - What a wimp. - Dude, I mean, yeah. For a guy that's like, \"I give you my word as a Biden,\" he told us time and time again, if not even God could get me to drop out of this race. Not even God. Okay, well, it's a little blasphemous, I think, what you've just done. - Yeah, exactly. Yeah, well, nothing to stand up about him. I mean, but that's a typical politician. - Yeah, that's true. And then he's gone. - Yeah. - My man, he's banished. I mean, they didn't even let him stay the night. - Yeah. - How insulting is that? And then they don't even send him back. He's going back to Delaware. - And this is a smaller thing from our point of view, but here's another example about how they're lying to the American people. This Democratic Party today, you know, there's a lot of baloney in politics historically. It's always been the case. And when I was in politics, you know, not that we, I didn't play politics the political way too. And, you know, there's puffing and there's hyperbole and there's, you know, all the different things that go on between you and the guy or the woman that you're running against. But this Democratic Party, man, they just lie and lie and lie about everything. And the way they're treating Biden as if he didn't exist after they made him the president and they hit him for all those years and lied to us about his cognitive incapacity. And then when they got exposed and they can't hide it anymore and they dump him. And now just a few weeks later, they're pretending like he doesn't exist. They're hiding him. That's another form of how they lie. - So does Barack Obama hate Joe Biden? Does he like, dislike Joe Biden? - I don't think so. - People say Obama's behind this. - Oh, I think, oh, there's no doubt in my mind that Obama's behind this. You can take that to the bank. Pelosi too. And, you know, their donors and the movers and shakers, the elites of the Democrat Party who are incidentally snobs and elitists who have really contempt for the working people. That's the thing that's wrong with the Democrat Party too. We were supposed to be a party of the working guy, but they have contempt for him. And there's all kinds of ways I could explain that if you're interested later on. But I don't think Biden, I don't think Obama dislikes Biden. He just has no respect for him. And he's a very selfish guy, Obama is. He has no loyalty to anybody. And so if Biden is in the way of something that he wants, Biden's gotta go. - So can you explain to me this video that we took because I was shocked. I gotta tell you, I'm not from the South side of Chicago. I don't think I've ever been to the South side of Chicago. My family comes to Chicago. We do the tourist stuff, right? Stay here. Maybe it's dangerous. We hear about that. We went to like O Block where there's, you know, a lot of shootings. - By the New Beginning Church. - Yeah. - By Pastor Brookson's church. - No, I mean, it's a rough, I mean, that's a tough, tough street to hit. - And we got out on a street corner that looked relatively safe. And we just started asking people about Trump and about Kamala Harris, right? And about Barack Obama. And this is less than a mile from the new Obama library that's going in there. This giant 20 foot, 20 story thing he's building to himself. And here's the answers we got. And I wanna get you to comment on it. - I go for Donald Trump. - Me too. - I go for Trump. - Trump the best. - Nah, I'm a Trump supporter. - I'm a Trump supporter, man. - Trump. - Y'all know we gonna need Trump in that joint. - But they ain't think Trump over on this side of town. - Look at my African-American over here. Look at him. Are you the greatest? - What's going on guys? We're in the South side of Chicago, Barack Obama's old neighborhood. His library is being built right around the corner from here. What do people think about Barack Obama here? And what do they think about Donald Trump? Let's go ask. Yo man, the South side of Chicago is rough. Abandoned houses, blight. There it is. Tough looking neighborhoods. Some of the deadliest in the world right here. There've been shootings since the start of the DNC convention in this neighborhood. We pulled up on a street corner and thought we'd just ask the residents here what they think about Obama and Trump. The last thing we were expecting were these answers. - You could be a scholar. (beep) - We didn't find a single person, say a single nice thing about Barack Obama. - I vote for Trump. - We talked like 2,000 people. - I go for Donald Trump. - Every one of them. - I go for Trump. - With extra the extra time, one woman wouldn't tell us. - Who you voting for in 2024? - Trump. - Trump too. - Told us Trump. - And why is that, ma'am? - He the best president ever. Never did anything since he been in office. - Yeah. - And I'm glad he out. Trump the best. - Barack Obama? That (beep) ain't got no message to him. I don't mess with Barack Obama. - Yeah. - Nah, I'm a Trump supporter. Trump do more for black people and care more about black people. And Barack Obama ain't black. Just to let that be known. - All right. What about Kamala Harris? - I don't (beep) with her either. All Trump, Trump all day. - Yeah. What's your message to Donald Trump today? - Keep going, keep going. Come get us, man. We waiting on you. - I love this guy right here. Let me get this guy. - So, okay, you get the point. I mean, it'll go on and on and on. What's going on there? - Yeah, that doesn't surprise me at all. You know, I spent eight years in prison, you know, and when Trump first ran in 2016, I saw some of the guys, my friends, the black guys, and they loved Trump. They loved his authentic style, that he's so not a politician, not that bologna stuff. And now the years have gone by and they had a taste of Trump for four years as president, the black community did. And they saw that, you know, things improved in their lives. You know, the employment for black people was way up, wages were up, cost of living was down, and Trump was on the side of protecting those neighborhoods. In other words, we need police in those neighborhoods. You know, here in Chicago, in that neighborhood, for example, you're 20 times more likely to be a victim of a homicide in that neighborhood than you are in the neighborhoods where the white people live. And we're a very segregated city. Obama let them down. There was a great deal of promise and hope as the first, you know, half black president in American history. He claimed to be a community activist, but I know him really well. I've known him since 1995. And I know David Axelrod real well. He worked for both of us. My strong suspicion is that Obama showed up to one community meeting for like a half an hour so he can say he was a community activist and then did his politics. And he did it for that reason, for politics. He's a very selfish guy. And that library that he's building over there in Hyde Park, that beautiful area with parks and that huge edifice that he's building against the wishes of the community because they wanted to keep the parks that way. And the fact that he didn't choose to put it any further West in like an Englewood neighborhood or Woodlawn, not far from there where poor people live or could have created jobs and opportunities. Another example of how he puts himself and his legacy and those things ahead of just everyday people. And I think the community that you just talked to, the men and women in the black community, I think they see that and realize that. And they had great hope when he was president that things in their lives would improve. But today after Obama, and now after three years of Biden and Harris, what they have are still the same things. High crime, inferior schools, inferior healthcare. Public schools in Chicago are terrible. And the resistance of the Democrat establishment to try anything new that can give those kids a chance in the poor neighborhoods to learn something and get out of those neighborhoods and build a better life. That's a racist thing, really. The resistance of the public school lobby and the Democrat politicians who cave into those public school lobbyists. I went to public school in Chicago and I was supported by the teachers unions, but they've gone really crazy now. And the fact that they don't, are unwilling to even consider anything that would improve the quality of education for children 'cause it gets in the way of their power, it gets in the way of what they're mostly concerned about. And that's with their pensions for their teachers, not smaller class sizes or holding teachers accountable to teach kids better or improving the conditions in those communities and those areas so the kids can learn better. It's really a form of, a soft form of racism, if not even worse than a soft form, because those are black kids who can't learn and they can never get out of those communities. And the Democrats have done this to the black community for generations. They're not the friends of the black community. They use the black community and black voters for the votes. And they could get away with it for a long time because the old Republican party under Bush and Cheney and Romney and those types of Republicans were never interested in doing anything for black people. Trump is, and Trump is reaching out to the black community, building this new political coalition with working class whites, reaching out to the black community that's been ill served for so long by the Democrats and changing politics and realigning politics. And you're seeing that when you went there today, that neighborhood. - So we were looking up, I was like, \"Why don't we go to Obama's house?\" And I look up Obama's house and I find this tweet. This is a tweet of a, some type of local news broadcast of an Obama purchase of a home. I had no idea this has happened. Obama purchase of a home, that's like a multimillion dollar mansion, but he used some notorious, well-known Chicago gangster effectively to like, to buy, maybe you know some of these guys, to buy the house and to buy like the lot next to it. And so back when he was just a state senator, the guy was living in a like $3 million house. This is like 20 years ago, when a $3 million house, $6 million house today. I think this guy was living large when he was telling everybody he was in poverty. This was like the Obama poverty story, right? I have these little girls and me and Michelle were just barely scraping by. I had no idea. Dude was living in a $3 million McMansion bought to him by a gangster. Is that true? - There's a lot of truth to what you're saying. Now, the guy that did that's not a gangster. He's actually a very good guy who got caught up and had some troubles. He was very good to Obama. He was the one, Tony Resco, who introduced me to Obama in 1995. And he's known Obama longer than me, knows us both. He was active in politics, raised money for Democrats and Republicans, very big in helping Obama and me. And Tony, after Obama was elected to the Senate, helped Obama buy a lot next door to that mansion that the Obamas bought. And they paid full price for the lot, $750,000. Resco paid all of that. 'Cause the Obamas didn't have enough money to buy the lot, the adjoining lot and the mansion itself. So they paid like 700,000 for the actual mansion, actually negotiated that down. But Resco was forced to pay full price, less price for that vacant lot next door to the mansion so that the Obamas can have that big property. Then when Obama began running for president and there was scrutiny about Obama and his dealings and Resco and Resco's relationship with him and me, Obama then had a fence put up to separate the lot from the mansion and gave Resco the bill, it cost $13,000, made Resco pay for it. And then Resco goes to prison. - What a dirty dog, man, that guy. - No, yeah, Resco was a very standup guy in many ways, and there's so much to the story, but when he was convicted, Resco, of stuff that had nothing to do with my administration and as far as I know, nothing to do with Obama, but the feds were pressing him to say stuff about me and Senator Obama at the time. And Resco wrote a letter to the sentencing judge saying, \"I'm not gonna lie about Governor Blagojevich \"or Senator Obama, I've never been involved \"in any wrongdoing with either one of those guys.\" So he protected Obama. And so then he goes to prison and they kept him in solitary confinement for three years, squeezing him to say stuff about me and lie, and he wouldn't do it. - Sorry, I didn't actually know that, I didn't mean to play a clip to like, you know, elicit any of that. - No, it's good. - Forgive me. - No, I'm glad you did that because it's important to know, I mean, how Obama uses people. And when Resco could have used his help when Obama had all that power, maybe cut his sentence a little bit, he let him sit there. - Well, Governor, the reason I'm looking at this up is that the Obamas go to the DNC and you wouldn't believe the, like, you really wouldn't think they were on food stamps, the way that Michelle Obama talks, right? We are very suspicious. I don't know if you saw the speeches. We're very suspicious of people who take more than they need. Lady, you have like five beach houses on private islands. I've seen the yacht that you and Tom Hanks are on in Greece. I see it, we have photos of it. It's bigger than like 10 of my houses. - It is shocking how they can say something like that and lie to the American people that way. That's so obviously not true. He's close to be, the two of them are close to being billionaires now. They've monetized the White House to become richer than Trump before Trump got into politics. That's one of the great, great ironies. What can I say? It's all upside down, but I think the American people are catching on. Certainly your listeners and your viewers are. - That's right. Adam Kinzinger, Adam Kinzinger was just up speaking. Let's go ahead and pop up the DMC feed here. We are listening right now to Kamala Harris's sister. - When some are trying to divide us, to separate us in ways that make it difficult for us to come together. Well, look, my sister rejects that view. Where others push darkness, Kamala sees promise. Where others feel detachment, Kamala fosters connection. Where others wanna drag us back to the past, my sister says, \"Hold up now, we are not going back.\" - This is the accent of somebody way to raise in Quebec. You know, this is that famous Quebec accent, you know? - Right. - Right? Foghorn Leghorn, very famous Quebec accent, yeah. - Because Kamala understands- - I think she spent the last couple of days on the South side of the neighborhood you were at 'cause she's kind of talking that way. That's the phony baloney stuff they do. They're so full of shit, these people. Can I say that on your show? - We're streaming, man, yeah, rock and roll. - It isn't just winning an election. - These are wealthy people. - It's about who we bring along and lift up in the process. - Multi-millionaires, yeah. - And they're talking like extras in \"Gone with the Wind.\" - Yeah, that's right, right. - What the hell is this? - And so as I look out at all of you today and take in this incredible moment. - They do. - They think we're stupid. - They use these stupid accents. - That mommy could be here tonight. - I like it, when I talk on the show about it, it's like- - I can just see her smiling, saying how proud she is of Kamala. - All right, I mean, you know, but if I went and did a speech in Louisiana, everyone knows the way I talk. And I'm like, \"Oh, darn!\" Like, everyone would be like, \"Get your ass out of here, \"you fraud,\" right? They'd like run me out with a pitchfork and then rightfully so. But somehow they allow this. - To elect a leader who sees the potential in each of us. - It's gone, it's gone. - A leader who cares for all of us. - 'Cause she needs to appeal to the suburban white women now. - Our democratic nominee, my big sister, the next president of the United States, Kamala Harris. - So when she goes to a community in like the Jamaican population, maybe somewhere in New York City or whatever, I'm sure she's talking a lot more like Bob Marley than she is. - You know, we've seen this the entire time. Okay, now she's done. We've seen this the entire time, you know. It's that famous Hillary Clinton clip. I ain't no ways tired. We do have Adam Kinzinger. You wondered if Adam Kinzinger cried. We have some Adam Kinzinger crying clips for you. - Before you do that, Benny, can I ask you something? - Oh yeah, please. - If he starts talking like a black person, I'm leaving. - Okay. (both laughing) You can't see her. - Okay, I've had enough. - I don't think the guy has enough testosterone to talk like a black person or any man, quite frankly. Here we go. - But listen, you never thought you'd see me here, did you? (audience laughing) But I've learned something about the Democratic Party. And I want to let my fellow Republicans in on the secret. The Democrats are as patriotic as us. (audience cheering) - He was crying. You called it. He was almost crying. - He cries a lot. - You can hear his voice cracking. Do we have more? Give me my Kinzinger fix. Let's go. - Donald Trump is a weak man pretending to be strong. - As he says that, as he's cheering up. He says it as like salt is rolling down his cheeks. - He is a small man pretending to be big. - Dude, Adam Kinzinger is like five foot tall. - Is he that short? - He's pretty tall. He's pretty short, yeah. He's talking about being a small man. - He's a perpetrator who can't stop playing the victim. - Hey guys, the quality of these clips, is it my? Is it the clip quality or the? - He puts on quite a show but there is no real strength. - Let's get quality clips here, okay? Test that. Where's the next one? Adam Kinzinger, I am proud to be in the trenches with you as sometimes an awkward alliance. We have to defend the truth. Okay, so he's talking about awkward alliances. Okay, got it. We got that one. I can do one more Adam Kinzinger crying clip. Do you know Kinzinger? - No, no. He's from Illinois though and I know of him. I haven't had the good fortune of having that. - To your great credit, actually, that you don't know. Why does Illinois have so many big personalities coming out of the state? - Do we? - Well, you know, there's a lot of like notable people from Illinois. Yeah, you come off the top of the head. - Name a few. We got Obama, of course. - Well, Obama, right? You have the Daley family, I guess. Pritzker is a, I guess you could call him a big or huge personality. - I would say he fills up the screen, but I wouldn't say he's a big figure. - Yeah, I mean, yeah, his blood type's ozempic. And, you know, I don't like, let's see, who else? - Well, we have Reverend Jackson. - Yeah, Jackson. - He's legitimate. - Kinzinger's made it kind of to the disgrace, yeah. - Single-A ball. Jackson's a major leaguer. - Ladies and gentlemen, we have one more speak. We have Roy Cooper. You can see Roy Cooper speaking here. - I fight for you to the very end. - Okay. He's speaking before Kamala. Kamala comes out afterward. Am I saying that right, Kamala? - Kamala will fight for you. - I'm not sure. Is it Kamala or Kamala? - Who want better schools for their kids. - My daughters keep correcting me and tell me it's Kamala. Remember Kama. And that it's somehow you're offending her or something if you call her Kamala, is that right? - Yeah, I'm not sure. - I mean, these speech police, they're all over the place. - Yeah, exactly. These guys are the ones who call Trump Hitler. So no, I'm not gonna say Kamala the way you want me to say Kamala. I call her Commie Kamala is what I call her. - You know, with a name like Blagojevich, I got a confession to make over the years, people have mispronounced it. If I was sensitive like these people, man, who knows what I'd do to those people. - So let's get one more Kinzinger clip in here. And then we'll go to the feed because Kamala, this is the guy that speaks before her. - I'm Adam Kinzinger and I am proud to be in the trenches with you. As part of this sometimes awkward alliance that we have to defend truth, defend democracy, and decency. - I have an announcement for you, governor, that Adam Kinzinger tonight on stage started Cucks for Harris. (laughing) - It was after he got one of those free vasectomies, probably. I gotta tell you something, that one surprised me. Right? - So that's a very historic moment, actually. Yeah, so welcoming him to the stage was the vasectomy van. So he drove in the vasectomy van to the stage, yeah. He asked for an extra bumpy ride. - Yeah. - Yeah. He converted to Judaism on the way. All right, well, ladies and gentlemen, why don't we go to Roy Cooper? Looks like he's done. So Kamala's up next. Let's rock and roll. We're gonna take this live. (audience cheering) Feet a little choppy here, boys. - She grew up in a tight-knit neighborhood. - Okay. Looking better. - It was the kind of place where your neighbor would look after you when school went out. - Here we go. - Where your first grade teacher would show up at your law school graduation. It's where Kamala Harris learned what it means to be in the middle class, making every paycheck count. She was raised by a working mom who taught her about standing up for what's right and protecting the people you love. - Kamala carries the lessons of our mother, the fighting spirit of our mother, the compassion. - She was all of five feet tall. If you met her, you would have thought she was seven feet tall. And our mother, if I'd ever come home complaining about anything, she wouldn't have it. The first thing she'd say is, \"Well, just stop the complaining. \"Just tell me what you're gonna do about it.\" - And since she was a young girl, Kamala Harris has been fighting for families like the ones she grew up with. - That is Kamala. She can't help herself from standing up for people and standing up for what she thinks is right. She has been that way our whole lives. Being a protector is what led her to become a prosecutor. Looking back now, I could say it was her calling. - As a courtroom prosecutor, she went after predators who targeted women and children and fraudsters who ripped off working families. And she put dangerous gang members and human traffickers behind bars. - We didn't have partnerships with DOJ or FBI or DEA or any of those law enforcement agencies. Now, we all work collaboratively. She was the person who built the foundation in how we do criminal justice in America. - As Attorney General of California, she held the big Wall Street banks accountable for fraud, winning $20 billion for California families. She took on one of the largest for-profit colleges that was scamming students. And in the Senate, she fought for her constituents with the determination of the prosecutor. Standing up for reproductive freedom. - Can you think of any laws that give the government the power to make decisions about the male body? - I'm not thinking of any right now, Senator. - She fought to keep our children safe from the terror of gun violence. - How many of you guys had to have a drill where you learned about how you need to hide in a closet or crouch in a corner in the event that there was a mass shooter? Look at that, look at that. - On the Intelligence Committee, she defended our nation against foreign adversaries. And in 2020, she made history as the first woman to be elected vice president of the United States. She cast the tie-breaking vote to deliver urgent relief to the American people during the pandemic. She beat big pharma to lower prescription drug costs and capped the cost of insulin. And led the fight to restore reproductive rights after Roe v. Wade was overturned. - We have worked too hard and fought too long to see our daughters grow up in a world with fewer rights than our mothers. - Because she's never been afraid to stand up to powerful interests. - Sometimes people will open the door for you and leave it open, sometimes they won't. And then you need to kick that (beep) door down. (audience laughing) Excuse my language. - Nah, she's really impressive. - It was totally organic. They didn't plan that in the mirror for days. That was organic. - Our campaign is about saying we trust the people. - She's a girl boss. - We're saying we just want fairness. We want dignity for all people. And we are a work in progress. We haven't yet quite reached all of those ideals, but we will die trying 'cause we love our country. We believe in our country. We're not falling for these folks who are trying to divide us, trying to pull us apart. We know what we stand for and we stand for the people. - A strong woman, strong female character. She's a strong female character. - And we stand for freedom. We stand for justice. We stand for equality. And so we will fight for all of it. - That's who Kamala Harris is. That's what she believes. That's what she'll fight for every day. \u266a Freedom, freedom, where are you \u266a \u266a 'Cause I need freedom too \u266a \u266a I break chains about myself \u266a \u266a Won't let my freedom ride in hell, hey \u266a \u266a I'ma keep on running \u266a \u266a 'Cause the winner don't quit on themselves \u266a - How much does this like Obama? - She's not as talented politically as Obama. And there's a quality to her, and I think that the more we see her, and the voters see her- - Please welcome the Democratic nominee for president, Vice President of the United States of America, Kamala Harris. - She talks about her life as a prosecutor. She oughta talk about what she did to Jemima Trulov. - Trulov. - Trulov. - Yep. - 13 years in prison for a murder he didn't commit, and there's no way to expect that her life is evidence of previous innocence, as she and her people refused to allow them to get on the court to actually convict an innocent man. She railroaded an innocent man, eventually he got justice after being 67 years in prison, or 14 years, whatever it was that he did. But it's an example of some of these prosecutors are so dishonest under them, and it's all about winning convictions, so she can run for office. And that's how she treated him, a black guy that got totally screwed by her. And that was a gross injustice, and you know, what does the Bible teach us? Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor. I mean, I'd call that a lot worse than just false witness against thy neighbor. - I think if these people touched the Bible, they'd spontaneously combust my brother. - Well, they eliminated one nation under God from the Pledge of Allegiance, which is a remarkable thing, because the Democratic Party I was in, and most of us Democrats believe in God, love our country, support the police, go ahead. - You were in a different era, homie. - Yeah, it's a very different party. - It's like, this is, I saw them carrying all those sticks. - It's a very different party. - Yeah. - And we're looking at the candidate that was anointed, it's a coronation. - Bro, yeah, nobody voted. There's political bosses in the back room. - Nobody voted for her. She lost every single time she tried to run. Every single time she tried to run for office, she didn't even make it to Iowa. - Yeah, that's exactly right. That's exactly right. - She didn't even make it to Iowa. - So I've been to four Democrat conventions, and I've been there. I was there when Obama gave his speech in 2004 in Boston at Catapult to Hamlet. I was there in 2008 when Obama was nominated in Denver. I was there in 2004 in 1996 here in Chicago with Clinton's re-election. And what they do is their Democrat operatives will come on the floor there and really encourage people to make all kinds of noise. That's not surprising. Republicans maybe do that too. But I think this has been a concerted effort to really jazz up the noise they're making. - Yes, clearly. - Good evening. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. - They definitely put Muzanix in the water. - Thank you, thank you, thank you. - At the United Center. - I gotta say, Benny, I have great respect for you and great regard and appreciate your show. The only reason I'm watching this is 'cause you were having me watch this. - You know, it's like-- - 'Cause if you didn't invite me tonight, I'd be home watching baseball. - Thank you all. Okay, we gotta get to some business. - Cubs or socks? - Cubs. - We gotta get to some business. Okay, thank you all. - Do you remember that funny picture Obama threw? - Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. - Yeah, I know. - Thank you, thank you, please, thank you, please. - It was left-handed, though. - Thank you so very much. Thank you, everyone. - Here we go. - Thank you, everyone, thank you. - Look at how desperate she is to find the prompter. - Okay, let's get to business. Let's get to business. - Here we go. - All right. - Oh, she's so bad. - Yeah, it's off the prompter. - You're so right. She's so politically unskilled. - So let me start by thanking my most incredible husband, Doug. - Marmy already. (audience cheering) - Okay, let's get to business. - For being an incredible partner to me and incredible father to Colin Ella, and happy anniversary, Dougie. (audience cheering) - There's the laugh. There's the first laugh. - I love you so very much. - Oh, look, Antifa's in the audience. - To our president, Joe Biden. (audience cheering) - It's so brutal. - When I think about the path that we have traveled together, Joe, I am filled with gratitude. Your record is extraordinary as history will show, and your character is inspiring, and Doug and I love you and Jill and are forever thankful to you both. - They should do another fake phone call where Joe Biden calls in on a recording line. That'd be neat. Yeah, so real quick. - And to Coach Tim Walz. - I've used teleprompters, so a lot of your viewers and listeners may not know, but they have three of them. See, I have one of you left and one of the right. - You are going to be an incredible vice president. - So you can see when she's reading it right off of her. Yeah, she goes straight to the thing. And she's probably spent the last- - And to the delegates and everyone who has put your faith in our campaign, your support is humbling. - And she could have been part of that too, trying to get a portion of them out while saying she was backing them. You know what I'm saying? It's very possible in the business of backstabbers. - Was no doubt unexpected, but I'm no stranger to unlikely journeys. - There's the left one. - So my mother, our mother, Shyamala Harris, had one of her own. - Now the right one, see. - And I miss her every day, and especially right now. - Can I talk here real fast? - And I know she's looking down, smiling. - We just wait. - Let me know when I can. - Yeah, yeah. - I know that. So my mother was 19 when she crossed the world alone, traveling from India to California with an unshakable dream to be the scientist who would cure breast cancer. When she finished school, she was supposed to return home to a traditional arranged marriage. But as fate would have it, she met my father, Donald Harris, a student from Jamaica. They fell in love and got married, and that act of self-determination made my sister, Maya, and me. (audience cheering) - Did she just confirm biological reality? - Growing up, we moved a lot. I will always remember that big Mayflower truck packed with all our belongings, ready to go to Illinois, to Wisconsin. (audience cheering) - Illinois, uh-oh. See, it's Illinois, these big personalities, these people. - My early memories of our parents together are very joyful ones, a home filled with laughter and music, Aretha, Coltrane, and Miles at the park. My mother would say, \"Stay close.\" But my father would say, as he smiled, \"Run, Kamala, run. \"Don't be afraid. \"Don't let anything stop you.\" - You think we're gonna get the coconut tree story in the speech, Governor? - Tell me about it, I'm not familiar with it. - \"You fell out of a coconut tree.\" - In my earliest years, he taught me to be serious. - Does she say that? - She does say it. - That's good, yeah. - And I don't understand it. - But the harmony between my parents and my past, when I was in elementary school, they split up. - Not a lot of coconut trees in the fields of Iowa. - And it was mostly my mother who raised us. - So you're asking, do I think she'll use that in this speech? - Yeah, I don't know. - I'm gonna say no. - Okay. - I'm gonna say the folks scooped it. - Okay, got it. - And the folks group said, \"Don't use it.\" - Good. - In the Bay. - It's cold, they're cold, and the folks scooped it. - In the Bay, (audience cheering) - You know, Ben diagrams. - You either live in the hills. - Ben diagrams, uh-oh. - Or the flatlands. We lived in the flats. A beautiful, working class neighborhood of firefighters, nurses, and construction workers. (audience cheering) All who tended their lawns with pride. My mother, she worked long hours. And like many working parents, she leaned on a trusted circle to help raise us. Mrs. Shelton, who ran the daycare below us and became a second mother. Uncle Sherman, Aunt Mary, Uncle Freddy, Auntie Chris. None of them family by blood, and all of them family by love. - Why does this sound like an infomercial? Like I'm getting such a strange vibe here, right? I'm not connecting with her. - They taught us how to make gumbo, how to play chess. - Like none of it. I don't believe any of these stories. Like I believe zero of these stories. - Well, that's right. And that's understandable that you'd feel that way when you get lied to all the time. And then, and the big lie, that Biden was capable of being president, and he wasn't, that she was in on it. Hard to believe anything she says or they say. - How about this? How about this? Stop talking about your mom and tell us about like what policy you have for the country that will fix this rolling dumpster fire. - That you've caused since your party's been in power for 12 of the last 16 years. - As you would want to be treated with kindness, respect, and compassion. - I don't need to hear about Auntie, Auntie Anne. - My mother was a brilliant, five foot tall, brown woman with an accent. - This is like the fifth time I've heard that she has a small mom. - And as the eldest child, as the eldest child. - I mean, yeah, I don't, okay. My mother was a member of the lollipop guild. - But my mother never lost her cool. - She would sing and wear tight pants. - Courageous. - And hold a lollipop. - A trailblazer in the fight for women's health. - She had an orange jerry curl. - And she taught Maya and me a lesson that Michelle mentioned the other night. She taught us to never complain about injustice, but do something about it. - Sometimes my references are very out. - Do something about it. (audience cheering) - That was my mother, and she taught us, and she always, she also taught us, and she also taught us. - What are your policies? - Do what you have asked. (audience laughing) - And that is a direct quote. (laughing) A direct quote. I grew up immersed in the ideals of the civil rights movement. My parents had met at a civil rights gathering, and they made sure that we learned about civil rights leaders, including the lawyers, like Thurgood Marshall and Constance Baker Motley. (audience cheering) Those who battled in the court room to make real the promise of America. So at a young age, I decided I wanted to do that work. I wanted to be a lawyer. And when it came time to choose the type of law I would pursue, I reflected on a pivotal moment in my life. You see, when I was in high school, I started to notice something about my best friend, Wanda. - She was drunk. - She was sad at school. And there were times-- - And somebody checked the liquor cabinet. Pelosi was supposed to swallow the cable. - So one day I asked if everything was all right, and she confided in me that she was being sexually abused by her stepfather. And I immediately told her she had to come stay with us, and she did. This is one of the reasons I became a prosecutor, to protect people like Wanda, because I believe everyone has a right to safety, to dignity, and to justice. - What's your policies? Hey, what's your policies? - As a prosecutor, when I had a case, I charged it not in the name of the victim, but in the name of the people. For a simple reason, in our system of justice, a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us. (audience applauding) And I would often explain this to console survivors of crime, to remind them, no one should be made to fight alone. We are all in this together. (audience applauding) - Empty platitude, empty platitude. - In the courtroom, I stood proudly before a judge, and I said five words. Kamala Harris for the people. (audience applauding) - You brought that up in Jumaane for us, right? - You know what, I'm glad you brought that up. - And to be clear. - I'm glad you did. That's good to check out. - And to be clear, my entire career, I've only had one client, the people. (audience applauding) - We find, well, when we fire you. - And so, on behalf of the people, on behalf of every American, regardless of party, race, gender, or the language your grandmother speaks, on behalf of my mother. - Oh my God. - And everyone who has ever set out on their own unlikely journey, on behalf of Americans like the people I grew up with, people who work hard, chase their dreams, and look out for one another, on behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on Earth, I accept your nomination to be President of the United States of America. - Wow. (audience applauding) - And with this election. - That was suspenseful, that was suspenseful. I'm glad she broke that one. - And with this election. - I didn't know where that was going. - Our nation. - I was worried. - Our nation, with this election, has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past, a chance to chart a new way forward. (audience applauding) Not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans. And let me say, I know there are people of various political views watching tonight, and I want you to know, I promise to be a president for all Americans. You can always trust me to put country above party and self. - Put country above party, and she covers up by incognito. - To hold sacred America's fundamental principles. - Can I say that? I don't want to interrupt that piece. - From the rule of law to free and fair elections. - And you say this with a straight face, and you're just like, no. - To the peaceful transfer of power. - Here we go again. (audience applauding) - Peaceful transfer of power. The guy was telling us that not God himself to get him to stop running. Look at this, look at these Batman villains from California. It's like an entire villainous crew. You got Pelosi, Gavin Newsom. - Who is realistic, practical, and has common sense, and always fights for the American people. From the courthouse to the White House, that has been my life's work. (audience applauding) As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, California, I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them. As attorney general of California, I took on the big banks. - I didn't mean to loop you into this. - It's brutal, 'cause I'd see the bullshit 'cause I was in the business. Some of these lines, I think I gave. You know what I mean? I think Axelrod wrote them for her, he wrote them for me. - I just ran into him at the DMC. - Did you, yeah? - Yeah, I told him he needs to put his mustache back on his fat face. - Is he nice to you? - I didn't say he's nice to me. - Oh, okay, no, he's not. - I said, he looks better with a mustache. - Yeah. - He was like standing in a hallway, and I was standing in a hallway waiting for the big T. Donald Fox. I was like, hey, grow your mustache again. For seniors-- - Is he a nice guy? - Facing elder abuse, I fought against the cartels who traffic in guns and drugs and human beings, who threaten the security of our border and the safety of our communities. - He's very good at what he does. - And I will tell you, these fights were not easy. - And I'm not saying he did, he had somebody else there, but this is boilerplate stuff, you know what I mean? - This is boilerplate stuff, like I haven't-- - Yeah, I mean, we all have humble backgrounds. Some of us actually do, like me. - Yeah. - But I'm not so sure hers is as humble as she's describing right now. Somebody should check that. - But we never gave up. - I mean, I wonder if she's lying about that, like she lies about how she's not against Frankie. - No, but how she lies about how she's not for defunding the police, right? Or how she lies about wanting to eliminate health, private health insurance. - And that's the fight we are in right now. - Am I right or am I wrong? - You're right. - Thank you, Bernie. - We fight for America's future. (audience cheering) - This is boilerplate stuff. Like, don't come for me in the comments section, but Michelle Obama's speech was better than this. - All Americans, this election is not only the most important of our lives. - Okay, what's your policy? Okay, this is like the fourth time you told us this is important. - It is one of the most important. - The third time you told me your mom's short. So like, what you gonna do, huh? Country's in shambles. What you gonna do about it? - In many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man. - There you go. (audience laughing) - But the consequences, but the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious. (audience laughing) - Here comes Prosecutor Face. - Consider, consider not only the chaos and calamity when he was in office, but also the gravity of what has happened since he lost the last election. - You asking me? - No, I'm just like reading some of the comments. - Donald Trump tried to throw away your votes. When he failed, he sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol. - Look at how she's lying. - Where they assaulted law enforcement officers. - It says, \"Peacefully protest.\" - When politicians in his own party begged him to call off the mob and send help, he did the opposite. He fanned the flames. And now, for an entirely different set of crimes, he was found guilty of fraud by a jury of everyday Americans. - Listen to this lie, weaponized prosecutors, corrupt prosecutors, abusing the rule of law. I mean, she's perpetrating that all for political reasons. Destroy the rule of law and the Constitution. You see, these Democrats ought to be kicked out of the United States and sent to Russia. And if Russia's too far, they ought to go to Cuba or Venezuela because they're taking away from us the rule of law by destroying it with fake crimes. I'm in. - Go on. - To set free violent extremists. - It happened to me. If it happens to you, you know it, you recognize it. - Who assaulted those law enforcement officers at the Capitol. His explicit intent to jail journalists, political opponents, and anyone he sees as the enemy. His explicit intent to deploy our active duty military against our own citizens. - What a lie. - Consider. - Think about what she's saying here. - Consider. - What the hell is she talking about? - The power he will have, especially after the United States Supreme Court just ruled that he would be immune from criminal prosecution. - She's got that like super serious inflection voice. - Donald Trump with no guardrails. - Oh no. - And how he would use the immense powers of the presidency of the United States. - You're getting a lecture like in second grade about the importance of not putting the crayons in the pencil sharpeners. - Not to improve your life. - And this is why you don't put green crayons in the pencil sharpeners. - But to serve the only client he has ever had, himself. - There you go. Snore. - And we know. - People inspired by this? I don't think so. - And we know what a second Trump term would look like. It's all laid out in Project 2025. Written by his closest advisors. And its sum total is to pull our country back to the past. But America, we are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back to when Donald Trump tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. We are not going back to when he tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. When insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions. We are not going to let him eliminate the Department of Education that funds our public schools. We are not going to let him end programs like Head Start that provide preschool and childcare for our children. America, we are not going back. - She's used like five different accents. Even your Antifa stepdaughter is like, what the hell's going on? - We are charting, and we are charting a new way forward. Forward to a future with a strong and growing middle class because we know a strong middle class has always been critical to America's success. And building that middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. - Yeah man, I think she hit the sauce. I think she hit the sauce before the speech. - The middle class is where I come from. My mother kept a strict budget. We lived within our means, yet we wanted for little. And she expected us to make the most of the opportunities that were available to us and to be grateful for them. Because as she taught us, opportunity is not available to everyone. That's why we will create what I call an opportunity economy, an opportunity economy where everyone has the chance to compete and a chance to succeed. Whether you live in a rural area, small town, or big city. And as president, I will bring together labor and workers and small business owners and entrepreneurs and American companies to create jobs, to grow our economy and to lower the cost of everyday needs like healthcare and housing and groceries. We will provide access to capital for small business owners and entrepreneurs and founders. And we will end America's housing shortage. And protect social security and Medicare. - Never heard a politician say that before. - I know, it's weird man. - Now compare that to Donald Trump. - Now that's a unique stuff. Now she's getting there. - Because I think everyone here knows he doesn't actually fight for the middle class. He doesn't actually fight for the middle class. Instead, he fights for himself and his billionaire friends. And he will give them another round of tax breaks that will add up to $5 trillion to the national debt. - Dude, she's talking about adding money to the national debt. - And all the while, he intends to enact what in effect is a national sales tax, call it a Trump tax, that would raise prices on middle class families by almost $4,000 a year. Well, instead of a Trump tax hike, we will pass a middle class tax cut. - Look at how excited people were in the audience. - Did you see that? It's great. - That will benefit more than 100 million Americans. - Again, it's like getting, it's like getting a lecture. It's like getting a lecture from the assistant principal in the third grade. - Friends, I believe America cannot-- - He's lying to you. - Well, yeah. - Trump has not proposed an increase in taxes. He's talking about cutting taxes. - This is insane. Like, I don't wanna go back to rising wages and low taxes and a booming economy. We don't wanna go back. - Yeah, exactly. - We don't wanna go back. We don't wanna go back. We don't wanna go back. We don't wanna go back. We don't wanna go back. We don't wanna go back. We don't wanna go back. We don't wanna go back. We don't wanna go back. We don't wanna go back. We don't wanna go back. We don't wanna go back. We don't wanna go back. We don't wanna go back. We don't wanna go back. We don't wanna go back. We don't wanna go back. We don't wanna go back. We don't wanna go back. We don't wanna go back. We don't wanna go back. We don't wanna go back. We don't wanna go back. We don't wanna go back. - In his words, quote, \"I did it \"and I'm proud to have done it,\" end quote. Well, I'll tell you, over the past two years, I've traveled across our country and women have told me their stories. Husbands and fathers have shared theirs. Stories of women miscarrying in a parking lot, developing sepsis, losing the ability to ever again have children, all because doctors are afraid they may go to jail for caring for their patients. Couples just trying to grow their family cut off in the middle of IVF treatments. Children who have survived sexual assault potentially being forced to carry a pregnancy to term. This is what's happening in our country because of Donald Trump and understand he is not done. As a part of his agenda, he and his allies would limit access to birth control, ban medication abortion, and enact a nationwide abortion ban with or without Congress. And get this. - She hasn't said, she hasn't said the word \"immigration\" or \"inflation.\" - He plans to create a national anti-abortion coordinator and force states to report on women's miscarriages and abortions. Simply put, they are out of their minds. - She's like, you can tell she practiced, you can tell she practiced all these lines, but she is not hitting them. - And one must ask. - Does not, not hitting them. - One must ask, why exactly is it that they don't trust women? Well, we trust women. We trust women. And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. (audience cheering) - In this election, - That's pretty macabre. - Many other fundamental freedoms - Show the guy holding a newborn - Are at stake. - As you like worship at the altar of abortion. - The freedom to live safe from gun violence in our schools, - He's like holding a newborn, yeah. - Communities, and places of worship. - Yeah. The guy was holding the, yeah, the guy was holding the baby. - The freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. - And that baby is maybe the luckiest baby on earth. - The freedom. - To barely escape the vasectomy bus. - The freedom to breathe clean air, and drink clean water, and live free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis. And the freedom that unlocks all the others the freedom to vote. With this election, we finally have the opportunity to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, and the freedom to vote act. (audience cheering) - Can I ask you a question? - Sure. - And let me be clear. - I've never been elected politician. - After decades in law enforcement, I know the importance - She's complaining about all these things, right? - Of safety and security, - But hasn't her party had power, - Especially at Al Gore. - And hasn't she had power for like, - Last year, Joe and I brought together - The last couple decades, her party's had power. - The Democratic Conservative Republicans, to write the strongest - And she's had power for the last three and a half years. - Border bill in decades. - So like, who the hell - The Border Patrol endorsed it. - Do you have to complain about it? - But Donald Trump - Yourself. - Believes a border deal - Yeah. - Would hurt his campaign. - Especially the last three years when Biden and her have been in charge of the Democrats. - So he ordered his allies in Congress - At the White House. - To kill the deal. - The things, so many of the things she's complaining about. - Well, I refuse to play politics - The things the Democrats that you fix. - With our security. - Yeah. - Dude. - And here is my pledge to you. - How can you bitch about how terrible things are? - As President, I will bring back - When you've been in power - The bipartisan border security - With a Democrat Senate - Bill that kills - With a unified - And I will sign it into law. - Democrat control. (audience cheering) - I know, I know we can live up to our proud heritage as a nation of immigrants and reform our broken immigration system. (audience cheering) We can create an earned pathway to citizenship and secure our border. (audience cheering) - Trump says he's gonna call in right after this. - And America, we must also be - Call into you. - Steadfast. - I wish. - How cool is that? - Call into Brett Baier. - Oh yeah, we'll listen. - In advancing our security and values abroad. As Vice President, I have confronted threats to our security. - Tell me when I can say a few things. - Negotiated with foreign - I don't wanna interrupt - Leaders. - Can I say something? - Strengthened our alliances. - You know, I always like follow the, I always kind of follow the chat and see what the chat wants to, okay, wants to hear. - As Commander in Chief. - 'Cause I don't, I don't like talking over people. - I will ensure - But this speech sucks, dude. - America always has the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world. (audience cheering) And I will fulfill our sacred obligation to care for our troops and their families and I will always honor and never disparage their service and their sacrifice. - There's another line. Can I say something? - Please. - See, the problem, when you've been in the business like I've been and you know these people, you know how they operate, not all of them, but most of them, see, Trump is so alien to them. - I will make sure. - 'Cause Trump is a guy who really wants to get things done. - That we lead the world. - He really, truly wants to solve problems. - Into the future. - But she, and there are people like her, these politicians like her, they're not interested in solving problems. In fact, they mostly don't. - That America, not China, wins the competition. - Why? - 'Cause they lose the issue. - Of the 21st century. - And as long as they can have the issue and point to problems. - And that we strengthen, not abdicate our global leadership. - And then blame the other side, they feel like they can win elections. - Trump, on the other hand. - That's the cynical design as part of that business. It's so just demoralizing and disillusioning. - Threatened to abandon NATO. - Then you get a guy like Trump that becomes president. - He encouraged Putin. - He's the ultimate deal maker. - To invade our allies. - And he meets with Pelosi, he meets with Schumer, and he thinks he can work something out with the border. - Said Russia could, quote, do whatever the hell they want. - Make it more secure, build a wall, and provide some sort of pathway to citizenship for the DACA, the kids who were born here and through no fault of their own, they're in the United States, but they're not legal. And you think Pelosi and Schumer would have jumped at something like that to help those families they claim they're for, they stonewalled you. And I think he was shocked in the very beginning that these people are so full of shit. They don't wanna make deals to even help their own people. So when I hear her speak, it's all bullshit in my mind, it's so frustrating. - Our allies. - It's all political talk, it's all political platitudes with no intention to really do anything. - With respect to the war in Gaza. - I was a congressman for six years, Democrat congressman, I supported Pelosi. - President Biden and I are working around the clock. - But. - Because now is the time to get a hostage deal. - Every morning you'd have caucus meetings, both parties do this, and it's what the frustrating part about politics and government is. - Done. - You go to these meetings, it was never about how do we find common ground with the other side and get something done, and actually help some of our people. - And let me be clear. - It's that it's like, you can't let them pass this, or we gotta push something that they'll never pass so we get the political advantage over them, you see what I'm saying, Benny? - For Israel's right to defend itself. - That's why Trump is so different, and he's so alien to some of these people because he actually wants to do something. - And I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself because the people of Israel must never again face the horror that a terrorist organization called Hamas caused on October 7th. (audience cheering) Including unspeakable sexual violence and the massacre of young people at a music festival. At the same time, what has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking. President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination. (audience cheering) And know this, I will never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to defend our forces and our interests against Iran and Iran-backed terrorists. I will not cozy up to tyrants and dictators like Kim Jong-un, who are rooting for Trump, who are rooting for Trump. - Yeah, 'cause peace was so bad. Peace with our enemy was so bad, it sucked so bad. - They know he is easy to manipulate with flattery and favors. They know Trump won't hold autocrats accountable because he wants to be an autocrat himself. (audience cheering) And as president, I will never waver in defense of America's security and ideals because in the enduring struggle between democracy and tyranny, I know where I stand and I know where the United States belongs. (audience cheering) - Dude, the tone's all wrong here, man. It's like, just, it ain't it. (audience cheering) - So fellow Americans, fellow Americans. - All right, wrap it up, wrap it up. Wrap it up! - I love our country with all my heart. Everywhere I go. - Here comes the accent. - Everywhere I go and everyone I meet, I see a nation that is ready to move forward, ready for the next step. - And I'll go back to the Trump years, thanks. - The incredible journey that is America. I see an America where we hold fast to the fearless belief that built our nation and inspired the world. That here, in this country, anything is possible. That nothing is out of reach. An America where we care for one another, look out for one another, and recognize that we have so much more in common than what separates us. (audience cheering) That none of us, none of us has to fail for all of us to succeed. (audience cheering) And that in unity, there is strength. - None of us have to fail for all of us to succeed. - You know, our opponents in this race are out there every day-- - That sounds like some commie garbley gook. - America, talking about how terrible everything is. Well-- - It is terrible. - My mother had another lesson she used to teach. Never let anyone tell you who you are. You show them who you are. (audience cheering) - Do you know that she has a mother? - America-- - Do you know she has a mom? - Not very tall either. - Let us show each other in the world who we are and what we stand for. Freedom, opportunity, compassion, dignity, fairness, and endless possibilities. (audience cheering) - I think I said those things back in 2006 in my re-election. - Yeah, oh, man, she's stealing your best lines. - Yeah. - God. - Not mine either. - We are the heirs to the greatest democracy in the history of the world. And on behalf of our children and our grandchildren and all those who sacrificed so dearly for our freedom and liberty, we must be worthy of this moment. It is now our turn to do what generations before us have done. Guided by optimism and faith-- - Say unburdened. - To fight for the country we love. - Un-- - To fight for the ideals we cherish and to uphold the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on earth, the privilege and pride of being an American. (audience cheering) - You know, when I wanna convince you of something, then I'm very serious. What I do is I tell you it like this. Let's fight for it. Let's get out there. - That's what I do. - Let's vote for it. - Oh, good, she's done. That's awesome. - This should be it. - This is it. - And together, let us write-- - Long on platitudes, very short on substance. - The next great chapter-- - And so many of the platitudes-- - In the most extraordinary story-- - Brought with dishonesty. - Ever told. - Just not true. (audience cheering) There you go. - Thank you. - There you are. - God bless you and your government-- - Kami, kami, kami, kami, kami, kami, kami, yeah. - Of America, thank you all. - Kami, kami, kami, kami, go. - She did say, she never wants, she didn't say, coconut? So, she didn't say, \"Do not come, do not come.\" She didn't say that, that's one of my favorite lines. Governor, how about the, yeah, let's cut the music and like listen to the actual professional, successful politician here, who, can you sort of give us an autopsy on what we just saw? If you're still awake. - No, well, you know, I think-- - I'm barely hanging on, I gotta tell you. - You know, she delivered a speech that was written and she read it off the teleprompter. I think her delivery was, you know, pretty good. I think that, you know, what she said, as I said, is filled with all kinds of dishonest statements. They hold this stuff, they've been planning a campaign like this, whether she was the nominee or Biden, to run against Trump. That's why they trumped up the fake criminal charges months before, in preparation for this, because they can't answer the fact that, you know, groceries cost-- - Put the shot up, guys, put the shot up, but like just have some two box. - Groceries cost 20% more now than they did when Trump was president. Loaf of bread is 54% more now than when Trump was president. Milk is 50% more now than when Trump was president. Can of orange is 71%. Dozen eggs, 126%. The price of gas is significantly higher than it was when Trump was president. People were working more, the economy was better. People felt good about the country. The reality is that if you poll the American people and ask them, do you think the country's going the right direction or the wrong direction? Something like 71% in the recent poll I saw says wrong direction. And so she's got to say these things and talk about things and really never, not address the record at all because she can't. And it's all about trying to do, you know, do what they're doing to Trump and then couple that with a lot of statements that weren't true and all these generalizations and platitudes. We all love America. Although the irony is this Democrat party really doesn't. And when you say to the traditional Democrat, I should say these new Democrats, this is the, and I truly believe this to be the case, the most unusual, greatest country in world history in spite of all of our problems, a place where somebody like me, you know, a son of an immigrant become governor of Illinois, somebody like her can become the, you know, democratic nominee for president. A guy like Trump can take what his dad started and take it to a whole new level. All kinds of great stories, only in America. It's why immigrants want to come here. But you say that to these crazy left-wing lunatic fringe Democrats who now control this party, the socialist wing of the party, who use Marxist tactics. You say that to them, they don't say America's great. All they do is look back in history and point out some of the flaws that have been corrected and are we're correcting still, which is how the human dynamic works. So, you know, she's saying, oh, we're all Americans and, you know, all these patriotic things. I don't know that most of the people she was talking to there really believe that, other than the fact that it polls well for most Americans 'cause most Americans still love our country. But this party is just not recognizable to me and their priorities are not about who they're supposed to be for, and that's like everyday ordinary working people. And they just keep lying to us to pretend like they are. The proof's in the pudding, the economy sucks now, it was great under Trump. And the only way they can beat Trump is to try to destroy him personally because Trump is leading a movement that's very different from what's happened in American politics over the past two generations or more. He's building a new political party, building new coalitions, and he's taken away traditional Democrat working people like me, joining this new Republican party, and he's reaching into the black community and the Latino community and making this Republican party very different. That's why these Democrats hate Trump so much 'cause they're afraid if he's successful, they're not gonna be the same party anymore, they're gonna have to regroup and they'll go away 'cause the Democrat party is really just about coalitions, not about any central ideology. - Can you explain to me the central ideology of, yeah, the nation's in shambles, yes, it's going to hell in a handbasket, the dumpster is on fire, I've been in power for the last four years, yeah, my party's been pretty much in unified power for the last 20 years, but it's Donald Trump's fault. Can you explain that to me? Are people gonna buy that? - What was the last part, Benny? - That it's Donald Trump's fault. - Yeah. - Yeah. Somehow this guy that was hamstrung every second he was in office, every bad thing is his fault. It seems a lot like ghost chasing to me. - Yeah, the whole Russia collusion stuff and everything they did from the very beginning when he became president, all fake and phony lies. They've been doing it since Trump started his campaign and became someone that surprised the establishment 'cause he had real support from real people all across the country. We're sick and tired of this phony baloney politics. I think the challenge, here's what I think, this election's Trump's to lose. When the American people think we're in the wrong direction, the party in power is in a position to lose unless the party challenging doesn't run the right race. So for Trump, he's got to execute his campaign the right way and he's gonna win. The Democrats have won the White House 13 times in the last 100 years and have never won the White House without winning Pennsylvania except for one time in 1948 with Harry Truman. In other words, they have to win Pennsylvania. I believe Trump's gonna win Pennsylvania. I believe she's a weaker candidate in Pennsylvania than even Biden was, not withstanding all of Biden's difficulties 'cause Biden comes from Delaware. He's got that working class background. He's like a Bojo guy. He appeals more, connects more with a regular working guy than she does. So the fact that she passed up on that governor from Pennsylvania because he's Jewish and that's why she didn't pick him. I think Trump's gonna win Pennsylvania. And if that's the case, he's gonna win the election. He'll win other places too. But for Trump to win, and I believe he's going to, and I believe he'll execute 'cause this guy's smart and he knows what he's doing and he's got professionals with him. They've got to simply expose her. The American people don't know her and they're gonna like probably, she'll get a little bit of a boost after this speech. I'm not so sure it'll be that big though. I think maybe a little bit, but I don't think much. 'Cause Pete, here's the thing. Most Americans don't know her, don't know anything about her. So the baloney she was spewing, I gotta say, oh, she sounds pretty good on some of the things. 'Cause she's basically saying stuff that they polled. All these things she was saying are things that the American people support. When Trump exposes her with the ads, social media shows like yours, her record, that's not a record the American people are gonna support because she is to the left of Bernie Sanders. And we're looking at a socialist candidate for president and her running mate is a socialist. And the American people don't want socialism because one thing about socialism, they talk about equity and equality. The only thing that's equal in socialism is what Winston Churchill said, okay? The equal sharing of misery. - The equal misery. - It doesn't push people up, it pulls people down. - Okay, I'm sitting here trying to figure out, did she enumerate a single policy? - No. - Did she enumerate a single new policy? Is she like a single thing, like anything? I was listening and I was like talking some shit, but like I was listening in to what she has to say. And if she was like, hey, here's how we're gonna fix the housing market. We're gonna do this, this, this, and this, this incentive and this and that. Like, no, she didn't say anything. - Exactly right. - She didn't say anything. Yeah, sure, she's like the country's in shambles, going to hell in a handbasket. And then she's like, but did you know Trump's orange? And he's Hitler. And then that was it. And then that was it. Okay, well, thank you. Thank you, I'm done here. - Right. - It's so weird. I don't understand how they get past that. I'm not sure how you get past not having any policies, not being able to enumerate. Yeah, sure, you can name problems, but like, aren't you the problem? - Well, the way- - Since you got to the power, weren't you the problem? - Right, and you gotta explain this to the American people and they need a dialogue. They're gonna run a campaign where they limit her access to the media so she doesn't say things that is unscripted. That's what they've been doing so far. So the campaign, the Trump campaign's responsibility is to expose that stuff. She's got the advantage of having the corporate media behind her. And they've lost all credibility because they're in the tank for the Democrat party. So the new media, shows like yours, these different streaming services and social media and all these different ways where messages are coming out these days, it's really elevated Trump. It's changing politics. And the good news is you don't have to rely just on ABC, NBC, or CBS anymore to get news. You can go to other places to get it. And that I think spells great opportunity for the Trump campaign to expose who she really is. And again, defund the police. She's for that. I don't care what she says now, but she said she was for that. She's on record. There's all kinds of tape of her saying it. She said, let's eliminate private health insurance. She absolutely said she's against fracking, which in Western Pennsylvania is a huge issue. Costs all kinds of jobs. You can't win Pennsylvania being against fracking. So she's going to flip-flop. And every one of those flip-flops are going to be lies. And every time she does it, coupled with other things, her credibility will go down. And I predict that when this election's over, if it's properly run by Trump, she's going to have real high negatives. - Donald Trump is on, on Fox News, ladies and gentlemen. Let's go ahead and have a listen here. Our team sort of locks it in. Listen to President Trump. - I closed the border and created the safest border we've ever had in the history of our country. She could have done all of these things and she could still do them. She's got four and a half, five months left. She can go there right now. She can do all of the things, many of the things we were talking about and complaining about. It was a lot of complaining. She didn't talk about China. She didn't talk about fracking. She didn't talk about crime. She didn't talk about 70% of our people are living in poverty. She didn't talk about housing, really. The trade deficit. She didn't talk about child trafficking that she's allowed to happen because she was the border czar and she presided over the weakest border in the history of our country. It's an invasion. I was there today. As you know, Brett, it's an invasion of our country taking place at our border, our southern border. It's a total invasion. And now it's starting at our northern border also through Canada. And she didn't talk about any of that because she talks, but she doesn't do. It's no action. But, you know, look, other than that, it was a nice-looking room. -Mr. President, Martha McCallum here. She says that she's promising middle-class tax cuts, and she says that if you are elected, it will cost Americans $3,900 more a year in increased taxes. She's tying all of that to this Project 2025. That's where that number is coming from. What do you say to that? -Well, she knows I have nothing to do with Project 25. They throw it out. A group of people got together. They did a thing. I haven't even seen it. I don't want to see it. I told them specifically I don't want to see it. People know where I stand. I lower taxes. She's raising taxes. She's going to give a tax increase of four to five times what people and companies are paying right now. The country will go into a depression if they do it. She didn't talk about interest rates. I mean, the interest rates are now getting close to record rates. People can't do business. Nobody can borrow money. People can't go to the American Dream and buy a house because they can't afford the interest rate. And even if they could, the money isn't available. She didn't talk about any of that. Now, if she got in -- Look, she's a Marxist. She always was. She always will be. She's going to leave the border open. I was there today, and the border patrol, as you know, gave me total endorsements and all of that. I've gotten endorsed by almost every major police group in the United States. But she is a Marxist with open borders. She's not going to have any fracking in Pennsylvania. She's going to close down the oil and gas industry, and our country is going to go bust. She didn't talk about the $35 trillion, which I was going to start paying off with liquid gold that we have right under our feet. We were going to start paying off debt, lowering taxes still further. And, you know, she wants to raise the taxes on corporations. What they're going to do is pick up and move to another country, like the pharmaceutical industry, move to Ireland, and they move to other places. Many of these industries were just very -- They're international companies. If she raises taxes like she wants to do on companies, there go those jobs. I'm more interested in the jobs than the companies. But there go those jobs. And what's going to happen, Martha, they're going to pick up. They're going to move to another country. They're going to pick up and move to another country, where they're going to be promised taxes at half the numbers that she's talking about and more than that. -Mr President, on the issue of immigration, Vice President Harris, like many Democrats in this hall throughout this week, have used the bipartisan Senate bill and your efforts to lobby Republicans not to move forward with that, to use the issue in this election as part of this speech. She said she will sign that bipartisan bill. To your point, doesn't talk about executive orders that could have been launched in the beginning of the Biden administration. But how do you respond to that? And are you ready to debate Kamala Harris on September 10th, given what you heard tonight? -Well, number one, debate on September 4th at Fox, and she turned it down, because, as you know, Brett, I was willing to debate with you and Martha. I was going to debate on September 4th. She turned it down, and I'm willing to debate on -- I don't like ABC. I think ABC is probably the worst of the group, but I'm willing to do ABC. I was willing to do CNN with Joe Biden, and you saw what happened there. I mean, CNN does not treat me or Republicans very good, but I was willing to do it because it was the only way I could get to debate them and ask him how that turned out. But, look, I am willing to debate, and I think we should do much more than one debate, but you know better than anybody I'm ready, willing, and able because I told you yes, and she turned you down. -And on the immigration issue? -On the immigration, it's very simple. The bill was horrible. It would have allowed millions of people to pour into our country. Would have been horrible. It was a horrible bill. It was a joke. She doesn't need a bill. I didn't have a bill. I closed the border. I have the safest border in the history of our country. I closed it up. As president, now she'll have to get Joe to do it, but she could probably have a lot to do with that, right? Now Joe's missing. He's on a beach in California. But you know what? All she has to do or all he has to do is say, \"I want to close the border.\" The border is closed as of now. They don't need bills. They don't want to close the border. I stood at the border today in 100-degree weather, and I will tell you, it's a dangerous place. And I was being told by Secret Service and a lot of other law enforcement, \"Sir, it's really dangerous here. I think it's time to leave.\" You wouldn't believe the things that I saw at that border. She's the border czar. Now she wants to deny that, but she's the border czar. In any event, she was in charge of the border. She's the worst border czar in the history of the world. There's never been a border so unsafe as this one. 20 people, 20 million people have poured into our country, many of them from prisons and jails, from mental institutions and insane asylum, and record number of terrorists. And other countries are releasing their prisoners from their jails. They're emptying out their jails into the United States of America because of her incompetence and her bad border policies. She is a horrible, horrible person to run this country. We won't have a country if she gets elected. -Let me ask you this, sir. There has been a huge appeal and momentum for women voters. She's trying to pull the youth vote, the Hispanic vote, the black vote back in her direction. Polls show that she's having some success in that at this point. So what are you gonna do? What's your strategy to rebuild the momentum that you had with those voters? -No, she's not having success. I'm having success. I'm doing great with the Hispanic voters. I'm doing great with black men. I'm doing great with women because women want safety. They want safety, and they don't have safety when they have somebody allowing 20 million people into our country, many of them very dangerous people. No, it's only in your eyes that they have that, Martha. We're doing very well in the polls. We're leading in most of the polls. And in the swing states, we're leading in almost every one of them. -Mr. President, let me interrupt. -The autoworkers are voting for me because you're not gonna have an auto industry if she gets elected. They're going to all electric cars. All electric cars are gonna be made in China. And you're not gonna have -- You literally will not have an auto industry. The United Autoworkers ought to be ashamed of themselves. They sold the workers down the tubes. -Two quick things as we wrap up here, Mr. President. Tomorrow, do you expect to be endorsed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.? And are you making a specific effort in Georgia to make up, if you will, with the governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp? -Well, I just saw Brian on a very good man. Did you ever hear of a man named Sean Hannity? And he was interviewed by Sean Hannity. And he was very nice, and he said he wants Trump to win, and he's gonna work with me 100%. And I think we're gonna have a very good relationship with Brian Kemp. And that was on just before you people went on with that speech that we just listened to. -And RFK Jr.? -It just happened. And as far as RFK, I've had a great relationship with him over the years. I respect him. He respects me. I have no idea if he's going to endorse me. I know he's got a news conference. We happen to be in the same state. Arizona will be in the same state, but in quite different parts of the state. But it's possible we will be meeting tomorrow, and we'll be discussing it. -He said, look, he was treated very unfairly by the Democrats. He would've beaten Joe Biden in a Democrat primary. I have no doubt about it. And they made it absolutely impossible for him. They made it that you have to get 60%, 70% of the vote just to get in. And you know what? In the end, the Democrats did the same thing to Joe Biden. They threw Joe Biden out of the party. They did the same thing as they did to RFK. -Mr. President, thank you so much for the time. We appreciate that live feedback. -Stay right here. Live edition of \"Gutfeld\" is coming up. Thank you so much for joining us from Chicago. It's been a great week. -Let Trump cook. Let him cook. Let Trump cook. Okay, so that was Trump. Trump's -- It's genius. You never hear that, like an immediate rebuttal by the candidate? -No, he's very different. It's beautiful what he just did because he pointed out the things that the campaign will do, to point those things out to the voters. And this is why I think it's his to lose. He's got to execute. -Yes. So the polling. Talk us through this. -Polling cannot -- -And you advise the president. I mean, you and Trump are close. Trump knows you. Trump likes you. Trump wants you to run for office. -He might. -Yeah. -I love Donald Trump, you know, because look what he did for me. He gave my daughters, my little girls, their father back. He didn't have to do it. I was a Democrat governor. -Sure. -Sitting in prison on nine crimes, victim of weaponized prosecutors. And I fought back. I would never give in. They dangled light sentences. I wouldn't take it. And they were, at one point, threatening me with 30 life, 30 years of life. I never took a penny. No one even says I did. It was all politics. And Obama started it. Reached out to make a political deal with me. So they criminalized it with me, and he goes to the White House anyway. Trump pulls me out of prison because I knew him just a little bit from that show \"Celebrity Apprentice,\" and he was so good to me then. And I saw sides of Donald Trump that people don't really see. Off-camera, not a politician, so kind to people on a day-to-day basis. Really kind to my little girls when, you know, their father was facing all of this terrible stuff. So I know him a little bit. And we have a unique bond because, you know, when you go through what I went through, victimized by weaponized prosecutors, rigged trials. They tried me twice. Used a fake standard to get convictions like they did the same thing with Trump in New York. When they do that to you, meaning me, the governor, and now he goes through it, really there's only a couple of guys in the world who have gone through it at that level. Politics, it sort of brings, it creates a bond. So if I was against pretty much every one of the issues he was for, which I'm not, but if I was, I'd still be for him 'cause he's a good person. And I've been around enough bullshit politicians in both parties where I, in my experience, I feel like I'm voting for the better person. You know, maybe I disagree with that person on X, Y, and Z, but he's the better person. And that person will try to do more of the right things as opposed to just the politically expedient things. And almost all of the politicians today are all about political expediency. And that woman who just gave that speech is 100% all about political expediency. She has no convictions. She has no determination to try to fix the problems of that country. They had three years to do it and they didn't do what Trump was right to say it. So you're asking me- - Yeah, the polls, like you, the landscape, what do you see? - In today's America, where we can't trust, of course, politicians and used car salesmen, lawyers, can't trust the media. A lot of our institutions have been compromised. I truly believe you can't trust the Department of Justice. I know you can't, in my experience, can't trust the polls. And the polls are not fair reflections at all about what the horse race is. The polls are political weapons used to try to persuade voters to go a certain way. It's a form of propaganda. And this inundation of the polls, once she got in the race, so much of that is baloney. And they can do samples. They're really polling, but they do samples where they oversample certain voters that won't really vote in the election at that percentage. And so they oversample in some places to jack up their candidate. You really wanna know what the polls are saying, the real polls? 'Cause when you run for office and I've won every election, they've all been hardly contested. You gotta rely on the polling. You develop your game plan. You really wanna know what the private polling of the candidates is showing, see how they run their race, the stuff they're talking about, and the places they go. And that'll give you a sense of who's really doing well and who's not. And the fact that Trump's doing what he's doing is a strong sign. He knows what his polling is showing. He knows where he's gotta go and the things he's gotta do to win. And what you're seeing with these Democrats with that speech tonight is a reflection that their polls show the only way that they can win is to destroy Trump. - Really? Yeah. - Yeah. - 'Cause that guy has been named dropped. Like, it's not the Democrat convention. It's like the anti-Trump hate fest, like burn the guy in effigy, like tear it all down. - That's right. They've lied about it for so long. - It's amazing that this tower, we're in Trump Tower right now. It's amazing this tower is still standing and these people are so fueled with hatred for Trump. They got no other vision. Not even their candidate was giving the vision. I still can't get over that. She didn't lay out a single policy, man. How you get away? How do you? You get fired, right? Like for your job. For that, it's your job. Then it's another form of being dishonest again. Think about this. You go buy a house, right? And the realtor takes you and the seller's got the house. If a seller and the realtor materially fail to disclose something, in other words, they fail to disclose a material issue in the house, that's fraud, right? When they don't tell you something. - Yes. - In many ways, that was a fraudulent speech in the sense that she's not telling you anything really substantial, right? And we have a right to know as the voters. And now when she goes out and is gonna avoid the media and maybe we'll do just a couple here and there so they can say they did it, it's another form of failing to disclose. - She's so brave. They do this big story. She's so brave. She's so strong. She hadn't done an interview. - Yeah, exactly, right. - Stand up to the biggest special interest. She hadn't done an interview, man. - There you go. - Like it's really like soft kid glove, like shadow boxing interview with like your friendly corporate media. She hadn't done it. - The American people are sick and tired of being lied to. I really believe that. - It's a genius move by Trump to call in. And just like, just big foot the speech. - Right, absolutely. - That's a genius. Well, Donald Trump on the messaging there. Quick takeaways, like Donald Trump's messaging seemed to be like, hold on. You're complaining about problems. You're an office lady. - His messaging was beautiful because he said specifically the major problems facing the American people and our country today. He talked about every one of those and talked about the things that he wanted to do to fix those things. And the fact that he brought those up just highlights the absence of those things in her speech, where she didn't talk about any of those things, just about any of those. - She didn't say the word immigration. She didn't say the word inflation. He didn't say these words. And those are the two things, that's like 90% of the electorate, that's the number one and number two issue. Open borders and inflation. And she didn't say those words at all in the speech. She talked about her mom though. Do you know her mom's short? - I was gonna say that's the takeaway. Trump's telling you about what he wants to do with the border. He's telling you about fracking. He's telling you about China and jobs being out, cars being built, electric cars being built in China. And she's talking about, our takeaway is her mother was short. Can I say something? It's really important for people to also realize that most Americans don't believe the system and are filled without, don't trust it. And Trump's straight talk. It's why he's getting support in the black community, especially among black men who appreciate his authenticity. This stuff is politically perfect. At the time he couldn't be better 'cause we're sick of being lied to. And sometimes he's a little bit rough in some of the things he says, but there's an honesty to that. And I think people really appreciate that. And I think too, because Trump's been around now as long as he has, as a large major, the most significant political figure in America since 2015, 2016. We know who he is. We don't know her. And the Trump campaign will expose her. And we're gonna see a socialist uses Marxist tactics and her vision for America is socialist. And it's a party that doesn't care about working people anymore. They just pander and talk about these different things. And the answer to the problems isn't to lift people up, it's to pull people down and bring everybody down to the same lower level where the other people are that they claim they're for instead of giving them a chance to go up. - Yo, that was the craziest line of her speech. Craziest line of her speech was, you don't, how did she say it? Nobody needs to fail for people to be successful. Huh? Like, hold on, like, what are you talking about? Like you've clearly never had a job in the public sector. You've never tried to start a business, right? You're just baking cookies. Like you've never tried to do anything in your life. Nobody needs to fail for you to be successful. For someone to be successful, that doesn't mean we all need to fail, huh? Like you don't understand risk and reward like in life. You don't understand the laws of gravity, lady. You're cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs. - Some of the best things that happen in life to us is when we fail and that's how we learn. - That's exactly right. - It's how you grow. Look, is our country gonna be safe and strong, prosperous and secure? The choice is very clear. Trump, if you want that, that's your choice. If you want Venezuela, if you want socialism, if you want a combination of wage controls that lead to scarcity and starvation coupled with KGB, Soviet-style police state politics where you weaponize prosecutors to go after your political opponents, if you want that, vote for this Democratic ticket. - This is, I just wanna give you the final word here. Final word here because it's an honor to have you on the program. It's an honor to meet you. Again, the state and the city where we are is a great American city and this was a much better state when you were running it and this was a much safer and better city and more vibrant city when you were the governor of the state. And that's just fact, that's just indisputable fact. What does this party and the speech, you were cringing, I'm not sure if you could hear it on the microphone, but you're just kind of cringing as you were watching it. What happened to this party? What does this mean? You know, this Kamala Harris moment as somebody who really made your bones, right, in a corporate Democrat party on a higher level. - The party's been hijacked by the socialists. That's where the power and the energy of the party is. To the extent that it has any kind of philosophy on anything, it's a socialist left-wing philosophy of, as I said before, pulling people down, not pushing people up. And it's got a strange coalition of these Silicon Valley billionaires who benefit in the way things are, Wall Street financiers who are backing it, also because, you know, they got to play it safe and play that side in case they take over. And these Hollywood movie stars, that's the new Democratic party. It's not the waitress anymore who serves you your meal at your restaurant. It's not the guys digging ditches on a construction site or working the assembly line at a factory. That used to be the Democrat party. They don't speak to their issues. Their priorities are not about those people. It's frankly about revasectomies and some crazy shit like that, this lunatic fringe that puts out. You know what I'm talking about? The new Democrat party, that's where their energy is. And it's really interesting. It's migrants over working people and poor people. It's gangbangers over cops. This is a fact for this, I know this Democrat party 'cause I was a Democrat. It's bureaucrats over parents and parental rights, and it's woke and cancel culture over free speech. That's the new Democrat party. And I can't imagine the American people, if they realize that, are for any of those things. - It's not good, man. It's no bueno. - That's not anything, that's gotta be sad. 'Cause actually it's kind of scary to have a political party that's all down for that kind of stuff, because there's only two political parties in the country. So like one of them can't be so effed. - It's frightening if, God forbid they win, I almost wanna go back to prison. (both laughing) - Okay, so I will say this, and then we're gonna bring on the great Jimmy Dore. We'll say this, and I wonder if Jimmy Dore agrees with me. Please don't unsubscribe. Please don't unsubscribe, because you may not like what I'm about to say. But it's true, and I feel it in my heart of hearts. I endorse the Democrat policy of castrating all their men. I endorse it, okay? I fully, can I donate to it? Can I take a collection at church? How many vasectomies can I fund for communists? I will do it. It might hurt, I will reach into my pocket. I will personally help you snip your balls off. I'll do it in the back of a van. I'll make sure you get into a dodgy van, no windows, going down a bumpy road, south side of Chicago. There's a couple of bricks missing. Who knows, you might end up Jewish by the end of it. Either way, I'm telling you, I'll fund it, okay? That's my promise to you. I endorse that platform of the Democratic Party. I love you, okay? Democrat men, hear me. - Can I save you some money? I'll save you some money, you don't have to. They've already emasculated those guys. (laughing) - Governor, it's been so awesome. - Thanks, Benny, appreciate you. - It's been amazing. - Keep up the good work. - So sorry this was so painful. - Well, the speech was, but you're great. - All right, all right, all right. - Thank you. - Fantastic. - Appreciate it. - All right, thanks a lot. - The man, the man. Okay, Jimmy, what's going on, man? What a great, what a great program. You got the great Jimmy Dore. Guys, we wanna do, we were doing three, we were doing three shots earlier in the week, but tonight the timing is just gonna work out, work out just right. And we got some legends in the household. And Jimmy's got a old-fashioned? - A Negroni. - A Negroni rolling through. Man, I got some, I got some water here. I'll pretend it's vodka. So what are we thinking, ladies and gentlemen? We said, why not, if we're gonna do the speech, if we're gonna do the speech, we said, how about the great governor, Rod Blagojevich, great governor, does an amazing job. Good man, a guy, again, this state was a much better state when he was running it. Don't care, I don't care what you, I don't care what you think about it. We thought that we'd have the governor because he'd be able to really lean in on the politics of the DNC and of the state of Illinois, obviously. And then we got to bring in Jimmy Dore because we need a comedian to make some sense of what the hell just happened. - So knowing what I know about Rob Blagojevich, what I know about politics now is that he was doing regular politics and they decided to criminalize it, right? He was trying to get something for, there was a Senate seat that was open, right? And so he wanted to use that as a leverage to negotiate stuff for himself, which I'm betting every governor does who has- - That's just politics, man, that's crazy. - And so they decided to, just like they're doing against Donald Trump right now, they're doing lawfare against him. They're making normal real estate deals now into some kind of crime and normal things that you would do to contest an election, they're turning that into a crime. And so it was great to actually, it was great to meet him and see him because when I started my show in Los Angeles, it was called Poppin' Politics at the UCB Theater, which is a very, anyway, so I used to do an impression of him. I don't do impressions, but I would just put on a wig 'cause he has that incredible head of hair. - It does. - And so I would put on a wig and I would come out and I'd be Rob Blagojevich and I would swear a lot, exactly what he said. He said, \"You'd probably just swear a lot.\" I go, \"Yeah, I would swear a lot.\" And I would be like, anyway. But yeah, so now I feel like he got set up and just like Trump has been set up. And again, I've never voted for Trump, but here's what I tell people, right? There is a faction of the, you don't have to like Trump to understand or see what's happening with Trump, right? So what's happening is, as soon as he beat Hillary Clinton and even before, the deep state, meaning the CIA and the FBI concocted Russiagate in conjunction with the Clinton campaign. And what did they do? They did that. They got the media to go along with them 'cause they had the same people who concocted that are the same people who control the media. So Russiagate became ubiquitous. I was one of the first ones, if not the first show, to debunk it because I brought on Bill Binney, who was an NSA code breaker, the top code breaker for decades, who the FBI also tried to throw in jail. He was so smart, he outsmarted them. They couldn't, but I brought him on my show and he showed me that technically, there's no way Russia has tapped into the DNC server. Technically, he worked that out. And he said, so this was done locally, which means Seth Rich did it, right? And so all I did was cover Seth Rich and I got a hit piece put out of me in the Washington Post by Dave Weigel, who was a pro-Iraq war guy in college. That shows you who Jeff Bezos hires to cover progressive politics. And so Dave Weigel compared me, put me in an article with white supremacists and literal pedophiles saying, \"This is what YouTube is doing.\" And Jimmy Dore is one of these conspiracy theorist guys. Well, it turns out I was right because now we know that the FBI is not gonna release Seth Rich's laptop for 65 years. 65 years, I was like, when I heard that, I was like, did Seth Rich kill Kennedy? Like, why don't they want to release his laptop? Oh, it's because there is the exact thing that we thought is happening, is happening. So I just wanted to say that about Rob Blagojevich. And it is, I would like to see what has happened if he remained governor. And not that I'm a fan of any politician, right? Because I think it takes a certain type of, as Chris Hedges says, the most mediocre of people become politicians. And that's concludes to people like Kamala Harris. That includes people like Barack Obama. Now you, I saw your video. That was an amazing video. So you went down to a black neighborhood, Barack Obama's old neighborhood, and you interviewed people and you didn't have to, you couldn't throw a, swing a dead cat without finding a black person who supported Donald Trump. - There were lots of dead cats there. (laughing) I kept swinging them. And my team's like, please, you're gonna get sick. There's gonna be a problem here. We're gonna have to get you a rabies shot. And I said, you know, I already, I got my shots. - So, you know, Joe Biden did the crime bill, which locked up, which is responsible for locking up black and brown people at much higher rates than their population. And the reason why they did that was because private prisons, right? So prisons, a big industry, just like the military industrial complex, which is why the Afghanistan war went on for 20 years. The Ukraine war, Joe Biden just signed an executive order that it's gonna go on for 10 more years. So as Julian Assange has taught us, Benny, and you know this, that these wars are not meant to be won. They're meant to be ongoing. Why? Because what Eisenhower said is exactly true. We must resist the influence, the undue influence of the military industrial complex. Well, we didn't resist it. They now run everything and Trump's big mistake. So what I tell people, what is I started to tell, is that there's some faction of the deep state and the establishment that wants to kill Trump. They did Russiagate. They pitched him four times. They tapped his phone. They really did do that, right? Not only his phone, but the phone of his whole campaign. And now they're doing lawfare against him. And then they tried to kill him. So there is a part of Trump that the establishment is allergic to. So that is not made up. That's manifest, right? And so you can't deny that about Trump. So as much as Trump, I think in his first presidency, he governed like a regular Republican, right? Except he didn't do war like they did. Trump made the mistake of thinking that the president controls the military and the deep state. And then he was disabused of that idea. He found out quickly, he does not control the military. The military did whatever they wanted behind his back. And they lied to him about pulling troops out of places. And they did whatever they wanted. And Trump and the president is just a puppet. And we know that the president is a puppet of the deep state and the military, because Chuck Schumer, when Donald Trump became president, he was on, Rachel Maddow, I know you know this, but let me just restate it, that Chuck Schumer, who was the head leading Democrat in the country and the head Democrat in the Senate, was on with Rachel Maddow, the biggest military industrial complex pig that there is on cable news, is Rachel Maddow. And Chuck Schumer told her to her face in 2016 that Trump, who thinks he's a smart guy, is being really dumb to call out the intelligence community, meaning the FBI, the CIA, the NSA. And Rachel Maddow said, \"What do you mean? What are you talking about?\" And he said, \"Well, if you mess with the intelligence community, they have six ways this Sunday to mess with you.\" - Six ways this Sunday. - To mess with you back. And what does that tell you? So what that told us, so that's called a gaffe. And in Washington, the only time you make a gaffe is when you accidentally tell the truth. And so Chuck Schumer told the truth there. And the truth was that the president doesn't control the CIA or the FBI or the NSA, they control the president. And the president better watch his P's and Q's, and he better be nice to the intelligence community, or they're gonna get him back. Well, he wasn't nice to them, and they did get him back. They did get him back in many ways. They got him impeached twice, they did Russiagate. And right now they're doing lawfare against him. So, and by the way, the FBI planted evidence against him in their investigation at Mar-a-Lago. We all know that now. And he didn't do anything that Joe Biden didn't do. Joe Biden didn't even have, so anyway, I could go on and on, Benny. Let me stop and let you ask me a question. - Well, this is a perfect setup to RFK Jr. RFK Jr. hates the deep state maybe more than Donald Trump does. That's, you know, having your dad killed and your uncle killed, they'll do that to you. That'll radicalize a man. And the ties that bind seem to be assassination attempts between the two men and their deep seething hatred of this ghost in the machine, right? This deep state. RFK Jr. presumably drops out tomorrow. That's what the reporting is. And the reporting also is that he'll endorse Trump. Your thoughts on that? - You're a guy who has interesting shades politically. And this would be, man, this is a wild look because you have Elon Musk on one side of Trump. You have RFK Jr. on the other side of Trump. You have obviously the MAGA middle. And it seems to be the political unity ticket of a lot of our dreams. - So I don't think there's a chance in hell that RFK Jr. endorses Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. In fact, I had gotten a pass. I got a pass into the Democratic Convention. I got an inside patch, an inner pass. And I was waiting because I wanted to ask Don Lemon 'cause he was there. I saw him, but I couldn't get to him. I wanted to ask him, who do you think has a better rack, J.D. Vance or Tim Walz, right? And what a better guy to ask than Don Lemon, who's gay and he would know. But they both have great racks, let's be honest. And I would say Tim Walz 'cause he's a little more feminine and feminine lends itself to it. - He's got a jazz hand situation going on, yeah. He goes hard on the jazz hands. - But I've already forgotten the question 'cause I'm three Negronis in. - Okay, well, RFK Jr. - Oh, RFK Jr. - You guys are, he's been on your show, no? - So I have inexplicable great affection for RFK Jr. He's appeared in my dreams many times. And I'm a Jungian, so that is important. And that's significant. But I did depart on him on his Israel policy. Now I'm a radical when it comes to Israel, right? And so I've been ostracized by Hollywood because of it. And, you know, I go so far as to say, I don't think Israel has a right to exist. No country has a right to exist. And that I always thought before October 7th that Israel was invented as a result of the Holocaust. And that made sense to me. Like, well, we should give them a state. Then I found out that's not what Zionism is. Zionism started in the 1800s. And then there was the Balfour Declaration, which I didn't know anything about. And then there was the Nakba. And so I learned all those things. And so all my Jewish friends in Hollywood, New York, and Florida feel very safe without having a state of Israel. So, and a lot of my viewers, by the way, disagree with me on this. And that's how, you know, my viewership is an occult because they disagree with me and they still watch me. - There's a lot of people who disagree with RFK on our channel, but they love the idea of Donald Trump bringing like more, more, more Americans into the fold. - That's right. - And unifying on the things that we agree with. - Yes. - And it's okay to talk with people who disagree with you and political consensus. That's how political consensus is made inside of a crucible. - Yes. - And so your thoughts on RFK Jr. perhaps being in a position of a CIA director. That would never happen. Maybe, I mean, you'd have to be Senate confirmed. You'd have to be Senate confirmed. That would be a hell of a fight. - That would be amazing. - But to be, you know, he could absolutely serve over. - How about human health and services? - Totally. - How about something like that? I would love. So, you know, Donald-- - The freaking FDA. How about just our pharmaceuticals? How our pharmaceuticals get pumped out? - How about Surgeon General, right? So what was revealed was even by Bill Gates revealed this, that Bobby Kennedy got the air of Donald Trump when it came to vaccines. And they were gonna have a Senate vaccine committee to look into the efficacy and the safety of vaccines. And why would you be against that? Because all we're gonna find out is that vaccines are fantastic, right? - I mean, I would love to have RFK in a position that Trump offered Elon Musk, which is a government accountability, like oversight, right? Like an executive oversight of government accountability. - I would love that too. - And like armies of lawyers, subpoena power and the executive branch, sort of a commission. And Elon Musk says he will serve on it. And they did this during their X-Bases. And RFK, I don't know, man, they're in Phoenix together. They're in Arizona together tomorrow. I'm feeling the vibes. I think RFK is gonna drop out. I think he's gonna endorse Trump. - So even though, Benny, like I may, you and I may disagree on many policy positions. - Sure. - Like Frederick Douglass said, I will join with anyone to do good and no one to do bad. So wherever you and I agree, I would like to join with you to help and push things. And where we disagree, I would like to use the power of persuasion to get you to come to my side. But I agree with you with the RFK. So that's why I think RFK, he should try to get a position in any administration. Whether it's Donald Trump's, Kamala Harris' or Richard Nixon's or whoever's, right? He should try to get it. Because I was saying before, he wanted to have a vaccine commission before COVID happened and Bill Gates got the air of Donald Trump and Bill Gates said, no, don't do that. That's a bad thing, which is a direct quote from Bill Gates. And so Trump listened to that guy instead of Bobby Kennedy. And that was a mistake. Imagine if we had a vaccine commission before COVID. Imagine how that would have changed everything, right? It would have changed everything. So I really hope that no matter who the administration is, if it's Kamala Harris, it'll never be Bobby Kennedy. But Trump has a chance to bring Bobby Kennedy in. So there's that sliver of a chance. So I hope it happens. I don't think Bobby Kennedy's gonna endorse a Republican, but the Democrats have so screwed over Bobby. They're the most undemocratic primaries. At least Republicans have Democratic primaries. Whoever wins the vote gets to be the thing. That's how Trump succeeded. And so he was probably smart to run as a Republican because, you know, Trump was he was never a Republican or a Democrat until he ran. Then he chose the Republican Party because when Bobby Kennedy came on my show the first time, I gave him a hard time. I said, I would like to get excited about your candidacy, but I can't because I know it's a fool's errand. Your candidacy is a fool's errand because they have super delegates in the Democratic Party. They don't have that in the Republican Party. They have a super delegate. And I said, Bobby, why do you think they have super delegates? So that a guy like you could never become the nominee. And soon enough, and he's disagreed with me. He fought back. He goes, I'm a Democrat. My dad was a Democrat. My uncle was a Democrat. I've been a long down life Democrat. Democrats are better than Republicans. He said that on my show. And then he ran for president and he realized those, can I swear on here? Those motherfuckers. They're the most anti-democratic Democrats in the history of the world. And so now it's to the point where people believe that he might endorse Donald Trump. That's how bad the Democrats are. That's how bad they are. You turned RFK Jr's son, who was an environmental champion of the left for decades. People can now go kayaking in the Hudson because of Bobby Kennedy and his lawfare against corporations. And now they've been turned into haters of Bobby Kennedy because of the money of Big Pharma, because Democrats under Bill Clinton's tutelage became the tools of military industrial complex, Wall Street, Big Pharma, and insurance companies and Big Oil. So if you remember, I don't know if you remember, maybe you're too young to remember this, but when Bill Clinton became president, he did a thing called the Democratic Leadership Council, the DLC with Al Gore. And that was like, they were gonna be the new Democrats, right? What did that mean? That meant they got so scared by Ronald Reagan that they decided to become tools of Wall Street. And so they said, \"Hey, we're open for business.\" And on the Democratic Leadership Council, the DLC, they had Koch brothers executives on their DLC. So there was no difference. Bill Clinton, he did private prisons. He had 100,000 new cops. He bankrupted unions by doing NAFTA. That was the beauty of Trump. The first time he was against the WTO treaty, right? And he did that, which the Democrats were for it. Barack Obama's out there campaigning for the, and Trump was against it. That was great, right? So, because NAFTA cut the legs out from underneath the unions for a generation, they still haven't recovered. So he did that. He privatized prisons. He wanted, he gutted welfare. At the same time, he imprisoned all those people with Joe Biden's crime bill. And then he was ready to privatize social security. After he deregulated Wall Street, he took away Glass-Steagall, which led to the crashing of Wall Street within 10 years. And he was gonna privatize social security, except 'cause he had a secret deal. According to Thomas Frank, he had a secret deal with Newt Gingrich to privatize social security. But what stopped it was the blow job from Monica Lewinsky story broke the night before he was gonna announce that. So he couldn't, he didn't have any political capital left anymore to do that. So that, so we owe a blow job to having, still having social security, which I'm a big fan of social security. I'm a big fan of a mixed economy, right? So I think that the government should take the profits from oil and gas that's underneath the land that we all own and give it back to the people and not give it to Exxon and Shell and Mobil. That's what I believe. But I believe in a mixed economy. There should be free market capitalism. And then there should be things that are privatized. There should be things that are government run like that. Not only that government run per se, but the profits should come back to us. Anyway, the point is, Bill Clinton was no friend of the working man and neither was Joe Biden. That's the biggest joke. They just crushed a union strike and they're out there pretending. And then this speech is just, it was all poppycock. It was all just like Barack Obama's speech was bullshit. You see Michelle Obama say that my parents were always suspicious of people who took more than they needed. - Lady, you have three homes on private islands. Private, private, private fricking islands that like regular people can't get to. - 40 acres on Martha's Vineyard. You know, he went to, Barack Obama had the balls to go to Africa and tell people that, you know, if everybody here has an air conditioner and a private car, the world's going to overheat. And then he goes back to his private house on Martha's Vineyard that has 40 acres. How many do you think air conditioners here? I'm going to guess at least 11 air conditioners. Then he has another house in Chicago and then he has another place in Maui and he builds a seawall. Did you know about the seawall? - Yeah, he had to get an easement for it. He had, he broke every law in Maui to do it. - Because, yeah, so climate change laws said you can't have a seawall. And why can't you have a seawall in Maui? Because it creates beach erosion down the road. He didn't give a shit. He got a cutout to do that for his property. And it doesn't matter about the, so isn't it amazing that all the billionaires, Benny, that tell you that climate change is real and sea level rising, they're all buying beachfront property. Isn't that weird? - Oprah spoke last night and she owns a thousand acre plantation. They still call it a plantation. She calls it a plantation. On Maui, she's the biggest landowner in Maui and she hasn't opened up a single acre to the people of Lahaina who had their entire homes burned down, who were trapped in their city as it burned. The government trapped them in there and burned them alive. That's a matter of fact. The AP reported that. Only the people who disobeyed the government were the ones who survived that. And Oprah has yet to open up a single acre of her thousand acres on a plantation. Yes, that's what it's called. For any of those people. - Let me let people know how many acres that is. So if you're having a hard time picturing, have you ever been to Manhattan or you've been to Central Park? It's enormous. It goes on forever. So Central Park in New York City is less than a thousand acres. She owns more acres in Maui, an island, than New York owns in Central Park. - She hasn't opened up any. I was thinking you could do like, for not a lot of money, you could do like container, like sort of homes. Like people have like little homes, right? You do like container. You can just give them a place to stay. You know, give them some like, give them a place to stay. These people just had their lives like torched and they don't know where to go. - I've been there. I've been there. I see the people living in tents. They're living on the beach. I've been there. You see people spray painting on wall, on building sites saying, \"This is a land grab.\" And you know why they do that? 'Cause it's a land grab. - They wanted to burn the city down. - Isn't it weird? It's so weird that- - What are you gonna put in there? - The most sophisticated alarm system just didn't work. They happened to cut off all the water. So the fire department couldn't use water to put out. These are just weird coinkydinks. And then all the police and firemen were turning people back into the fire. It's just, they're just coinkydinks. - They did that. They sent them back into like what was an oven. - These are coinkydinks. - The government did. - Yeah, all right. Well, remember, Oprah wants to raise money, wants us to donate. - She wants us to donate. She could have taken- - It's worth $5 billion. - She's worth, she could have taken a billion dollars and restored Lahaina herself. She wanted you to do it. - That's exactly right. - She gave $10 million. That's like me giving a quarter, okay? So she didn't give anything. She owns $500 million in property herself anyway. And by the way, buying up all that property in Maui, the natives who live there are upset about it because that raises the price of all the land for everybody else in Maui. - Of course. - Yeah. - And scarcity. - There's a homeless problem in Hawaii is a big problem. - So Kamala Harris, that's the name of the night. Did you watch the speech? - I watched about five minutes of it and it was fantastic. I thought it was great. It was her pretending. It was all platitudes and bullshit, just like Michelle Obama, just like Barack Obama. At least Joe Biden has the balls to come out and just blazingly lie. - Yeah, yeah, and yell and scream about it. But like Kamala, what was weird to me, man, and I can't get this out of my head, is she's in power right now. You're in charge. - She's pretending like she's not in power. - You're in power. What's this game you're playing? And you're gonna like tell us, you're gonna like sing \"Poor Honey in Our Ears\" for 10 minutes about your family and your aunties. And you're not gonna tell us anything you're gonna do for the damn country. This place is in shambles right now. - I like it. - And you're in power. - So I was inside the convention. I was on the floor for a little while. And the last time I was on the floor for a Democratic convention was the last time they had one, 'cause in 2020, COVID, they didn't have one. So in 2016, I was in Philadelphia and I was on the floor. And it was interesting and exciting, and it gave you hope about democracy. Why? Because half those people there were progressives who supported Bernie Sanders. So there was friction, which is what's supposed to happen at a convention. There's supposed to be friction and people are supposed to argue about policy. And that's what was happening there. The establishment eventually did whatever they did to Bernie and they threatened to prosecute his wife for the bullshit bank deal she did at the college or whatever, but he rolled over for them. And he didn't do anything with... Bernie Sanders didn't extract anything from the establishment for his support of Hillary Clinton. That's how it's supposed to work. You know politics, Benny. So if somebody wants you to endorse them, you have to give a concession. Bernie didn't get anything, nothing. - He got a new island house. They all get island house. Bernie has like three houses. - He got a book deal. - He got a new house. - He became a millionaire. He's got a book deal, all that shit. He became the banking chairman. The progressives are like, well, Bernie's gonna become the banking chairman. And what did that do for you? Fucking nothing. Anyway, so when I was there last time, it was fun to walk the floor. I would walk the floor and I would interview people and they had interesting ideas about policies. They all were understanding what Bernie was pushing and what Hillary was. This time it was the exact opposite. No one even cared about politics. No one knew anything. I was interviewing one Democratic delegate and I said, hey, does it bother you that there wasn't a real process for the primary this time to get the nominee? And the woman who I was talking to was a beautiful black woman. And she said, what do you mean? I don't know what you mean. We had a primary. I go, yeah, but they switched the usual primary starts in Iowa and then New Hampshire. They switched it to go start in South Carolina 'cause that would benefit Joe Biden. And then they said if anybody else campaigned into Iowa or New Hampshire, they would take away their delegates that they earned there. That's why RFK had to leave the party because they were putting in all these rules that would screw him. So he's like, I see what's happening. So that's the opposite of democracy. So anyway, I said this to this woman and she said, I go, why don't you, aren't you upset that there wasn't a real primary? And she says, what do you mean? They had a primary. And I said, no, no, Joe Biden won and then they forced him out. Yeah, but there was a process, she said. And Kamala Harris followed the process. I'm like, that's not called democracy. The process is called what a corporation does. That's not. And then I was like, okay, well, wow. She sounded exactly like a DNC delegate, right? And then I said, well, what's your favorite policy of Kamala Harris? And literally she said to me, criminal justice, a black woman telling me her favorite policy of Kamala Harris is criminal justice. Kamala Harris is known for locking up black people for things that she was guilty of herself, hiding evidence that would exonerate them. And then after the Supreme Court told her to release prisoners from California's prisons, she still didn't. And the reason why she didn't do that, they gave in court was because it would upset the prison labor system. Do you know what that's called? It's called slavery. I don't know if you know. So Kamala Harris was literally imposing slavery on black and brown people in California. And this woman who's a delegate to the DNC this year for Kamala Harris is telling me she likes her because of that. So it was honestly, Benny, I left there super depressed. Yeah, it was NBC world. We were there, I was there with Vivek and we were just streaming and running around and just kind of like, you know, chewing a fat people and it's kind of like, kind of like kicking the doors in, right? Like a little bit. Vivek knows that he's gonna be recognized. People are gonna yell and hiss and scream and it's gonna cause a little bit of a ruckus. And it was, when Vivek was doing a fox hit, I just wandered around and looked at people and we did people watching. Bro, it was like- - It was zombies. - Glassy eyes. - Zombies. - Like glassy eyed people. - Brainwashed. - Kind of like walking as like very, very NPC, very much like an Android world, right? - Yes. - Where it's like, everyone had a Neuralink chip. - Yes. - Yeah. And they were all like on the same wavelength and like Kamala, it's like a meme. It's like the chip was taken out, the Biden chip was taken out. And before the port even got cold, they shoved a Kamala clip in there and they were reprogramming update, done. Algorithm activated. - So like a convention traditionally is supposed to be where you get together and you knock heads and you work out policy and you find compromises. - Jimmy, I didn't see a single Biden button. So I went around looking. I'm like, can anybody find me Biden Jack? Nothing. A photo, a Pashmina, whatever, dude. A lady in a wheelchair with like a little Biden sticker on her wheel. That's all I cared about. Find me a Biden thing. That bro, that dude was straight up Stalinist level erased. He's been erased, right? That famous photo, Stalin and that guy and the guy's gone. - Wasn't it ironic? I don't know if you saw this part of the convention I did. They were holding up signs that saying we love you, Joe, when Joe, when Biden came. They had passed these out, obviously, and they were holding up, we love you, Joe. Yeah, we love you so much that we cooed you and forced you out of a primary that you won. That's how much we love you. We want you to get the fuck out of here. And we're putting you on in the first night of the convention instead of the last night because we don't give a shit about you. We want people to forget about you. That's how much they love Joe Biden. That was amazing to me. But by the way, I want to just bring this point up if I can about communism. So my point of view is that the actual Democratic establishment and the Republican establishment, which also hates Trump, by the way, the Republic, right, that there's so much alike that they have to invent these fake narratives to hate each other, right? So right now the Democrats are inventing this narrative that Donald Trump is going to become dictator on day one. He's going to become a king. And I would so I was at a Palestinian protest and someone said that they were they hated Donald Trump and they might vote for Kamala Harris. And I said, why? They go, because Trump will make himself king. And I go, well, what's the mechanism for him to do that? I mean, if Trump can make himself king, why didn't do that the first time? Why is he waiting? And that means that anybody could have did that. Why did Nixon make himself king? Why didn't? And they they don't have an answer for that because it's made up. Yes, because we have a balance of power in America. We have a constitutional republic and you can't make yourself king. That's why the that's why the president always has to negotiate with Senate and the Democrats and the Congress to get legislation passed, because there is no such thing as a king in America. And what was my point of this? God damn it. I forgot my point. Go ahead. What's going on? I do. I remember. Go. So then they each have to conflate. So so then the Democrats say that Donald Trump is a as a white supremacist and a Nazi who's going to make himself king. And then the Republicans call Kamala Harris a communist. Now. She's not a communist. What she is is a corporatist authoritarian. Right. And why do I say she's a authoritarian is because she's for censorship, which is the hallmark of a dictator. Right. Censorship. And they always tell you they're censoring people to save to protect you. And so they're going to censor you from people telling the truth about covid. They're going to censor you from people telling the truth about Ukraine. They're going to censor you from telling the truth about Russiagate. They're going to tell it. So censorship is, as RFK Jr. says, when in history has the censors ever been on the right side of history? Never. So that's what the Democratic Party has become. They became they were people who were always antiwar. They were always pro worker. They were always pro bodily autonomy and they were always pro free speech. They flipped on all those things. Now the Democratic Party is pro censorship. They're anti bodily autonomy because they were pro mandate, which is the exact opposite of bodily autonomy. Right. They're they're pro war. They've been for every war in my lifetime, including the Ukraine war. And I forget what the first one was. But they're they're the exact opposite of what they used to be. And so that's why RFK Jr. That's why I say the Democratic Party, I didn't leave them. They left me. I'm exactly the same. I'm for bodily autonomy. I'm for freedom of speech. I'm antiwar. And they are none of those things. I was going to shake out. Last question. OK, last question, because we were pack up everything and get back. We got it. We have five hours of packing. I know, but but I want to know. I want to know what has it been. You've done so much on this issue of like figuring out where the parties are right now. And I do worry about that zombie state. I do worry about NPC. You don't want 30 to 40 percent of the population that could just be programmed like that. You do want critical thinkers. And you don't want I don't want that on a Republican side. I don't want that on a Democrat side. It's bad for the country. But I mean, what what do you how do you see this shaking out? You've been very right in your predictions that you you're one of them. You're one of the Nostradamus. So what's happens the next 70 days? Well, it's funny. It's like all I have to do is say communists and it triggers like even my own audience. I have a lot of right wing audience, right? I have Marxists. I have MAGA. And all you do is say communists and they're triggered. So like in Venezuela, why do people have an opinion upon the the election in Venezuela? The reason why you live in America and you even have an opinion on that is because there's more oil in Venezuela than there is in Saudi Arabia. So now the media is involved because the deep states involved, because the economic hit men who run the country want the media to talk about this because they want people to be on board when we overthrow their government. Right. We've we've tried to overthrow their government a couple of times in the last 20 years. And why? Because there's more oil. And Trump even admitted it. In fact, he gave a speech where he said, you know, if I was president, we would have taken all that oil. We got all that oil. And that's another reason why the deep state would have killed them. Would it wants to kill him? Because he tells the truth. Nobody else will say that. They'll say, well, we want to bring democracy. So as soon as I found out there was more oil in in Venezuela than in Saudi Arabia, I knew it was just a matter of time before we had to bring democracy to their people. And that's what they're saying. Right. And so that's I want to make that. So don't be triggered by the word communist, because communists is that the people in Maduro in Venezuela, Maduro has a mixed economy. He has an economy where he runs the oil and he gives that money back to the people. And they have a lot of lithium down there and stuff. So he wants to take their natural resources and put that money back into the country. And the cap, the economic hit men who run the Western culture don't want that to happen. So they want you to have an opinion that this is over. That's a legal election. Hey, hey, let's say it is. I'll I'll I'll grant you. It's not. But I'll I'll grant you. Let's say Maduro didn't win the election. It's none of our fucking business. And, you know, I don't think the elections in America are correct. Right. So I don't want people from your own house. I don't watch 2020. I don't want people from Venezuela coming in here over and throwing my government to clean it up for me. I'll we can figure it out in the United States. So your question is, where do we where do we go from here? Where do we go from here? Is that people need to come together like the truckers did in Canada? Nice. And they need to shut down shit and put a hurt on the billionaires who actually run the Western world. And to the point where we make the government afraid of us again. And that's what we used to. You know, that's what is supposed to happen, right? The government's supposed to be afraid of the people. If the people are afraid of the government, that's tyranny. And that's what we're living in right now. We're living in tyranny. So we need to do things like we need to get the truckers and the farmers and workers of all sorts together to revolt against this government and take it back because we don't have the government right now that we live in a literal oligarchy, which is proven by a Princeton study over 10 years ago. Your your vote does not fucking matter. It doesn't matter because your candidates are chosen. The point that the fact that Trump was not chosen is why they tried to kill him. OK. And I'm not saying that if Trump becomes president, he'll fix everything. I'm saying that there's a reason why they're trying to kill him. OK. And so that's what needs to happen. People like you and me and people like people in my audience who have already realized this, that your neighbor is not your enemy. Your neighbor is your neighbor. And they want you to hate. They want me to hate. So that the oligarchy did a controlled demolition of our economy during COVID, which crushed everybody. And they want me to hate my neighbor for the economic pain I'm feeling because he wouldn't take a vaccine that didn't work the way they said it did in the first place. Well, I'm not going to hate my neighbor. I'm going to join with my neighbor and I'm going to oppose those oligarchs. I'm going to do it with farmers. I'm going to do it with truckers. I'm going to do it with workers at Amazon of all sorts, because that's the only thing that's going to take back this country. And if that doesn't happen, we're lost. We're we're lost to tyranny. We're lost to authoritarianism. We're lost to corporatism. And that's what and it's not just in America. I just did a European tour. The exact thing that's happening here is happening there. And they feel it and they know exactly the same. I did a sold out tour in Europe. I had no idea if I would sell one thing. I sold out everywhere I went and people I did meet and greets. And people came up to me and said exactly what you're experiencing in America is exact. Jeff Bezos doesn't just own the Washington Post here in America. He's also owns media in Norway. Did you know that? I didn't know that until I went there. He's buying up media in Europe. Those are the same billionaires who run this country are running Western Europe. And that's why we have the the immigrant crisis not only there, but here. And that's why they got rid of a cold. Muammar Gaddafi, because Muammar Gaddafi was a line between immigration from Africa to here, and they wanted to get rid of it. They he thought he was safe because he provided them that security. The exact opposite. As soon as they wanted to get rid of that security is when they killed him. Anyway, I could talk about this all night, Benny, and I know you're tired. Are you voting Trump? I mean, after that impassioned plea, like are you? I'm I'm writing in Dave Chappelle, as I always do. And so, no, I mean, I have a lot of I have a lot of problems with Trump. But I understand that there is definitely a faction inside the establishment in the in the deep state that wants Trump dead. They don't want Joe Biden dead. They don't want Kamala Harris dead. So what does that tell you? Right. And it's because he is a glitch in their warmongering program. And so, no, I won't I won't be voting for him, but I will be writing in Dave Chappelle. And I I think it's time Americans came. So at the Democratic Convention, they talked about, oh, the Republicans want to divide the country. You motherfuckers are the ones who are dividing the country. You criminalize this whole political operation, which was January six was for which was a psyop by the FBI to criminalize MAGA and Donald Trump. So and they're the ones who constantly are dividing the country. So we need to your neighbor is not your enemy. Your neighbor is suffering under the same bullshit that you're suffering under. Remember that you just have different ways to get to the same place. I will be voting for Donald Trump, but I will join with Jimmy Dorr and say I'd love to have Dave Chappelle as part of the administration. I think Dave Chappelle could do some great. And I hope RFK is a part of the administration. Totally. Along with Elon, Dave Chappelle, Elon Musk, RFK, Donald Trump. Come on, baby, bring it home. What a wild week. We have been live every single day, twice a day. And I've been hitting the streets and hitting the bricks. It's been incredible to meet some absolute legends. And it's great to meet new friends along the way and making some friends on the South Side, I guess, too. That's amazing. From the South Side. You know that, right? Those people will not be voting for Congress. They made sure they made sure to tell us. You know what, ladies and gentlemen, we love you. We thank you for following us along. We read the comments and we realized how much it is important to tell a true story out here. And we've set about doing that in the Benny Bunker. We're very proud of our work and it can't be done without you. So we love you. We care about you. We appreciate you. And from the Windy City in deep inside the Benny Bunker and Trump Tower, we say a heartfelt thank you. Now I'm going to go eat some deep dish pizza. Yes, I did that today. We're going to and we're going to we're going to hit it tomorrow morning. Big day tomorrow. Thank you all for watching. It's your boy, Benny. You are in the arena with Jimmy Dore and Rod Blagojevich. Final night of the DNC. Thank God it's over. See ya."

    "transcript": "(whistling) - In this world, there's two kinds of people, my friend. Those with loaded guns and those who dig. Live from the Montana Wilderness Fortress, Wednesday nights at nine Eastern, this is the Matt Christensen Hour. (upbeat music) Hello and welcome to the show. My name is Matt Christensen. This is the Matt Christensen Hour on Tenet Media. Thank you for tuning in. I'm joined, as always, by my producer down under, Tim. Good day, Tim. - G'day, and I don't know if they will be because he's streaming right now. I was on a stream yesterday, promoted the show. So if any of his audience is here, welcome. Good to have you here. - Well, thank you for that. You know, I feel like someone's playing a trick on me. Viewers of my Sunday show, The Matt and Blond Show, will know that we were delayed on Sunday because the third-party service that takes the stream and sends it to all the various places you can find the show just crapped out. So I had to send the show only to YouTube. All right, I wasn't gonna repeat that. So I test the stream earlier today and make sure that that service is up and running. We're all good. So yeah, around noon today, looks good. We're set. Come back over here about 6.30 my time, half hour before live. Fire up the old test stream again. Oh no, it's Christmas light time again. It's red connection, it's green connections. I swear it's like by the clock this company messes with me. So my apology for people who prefer to watch on X or Rumble or wherever you may prefer to view the show live. It's gotta be just YouTube tonight. I'm gonna go bang down their door tomorrow. I'm gonna go figure out what's going on here 'cause this is not some hamster wheel duct tape thing. This is a company that takes a lot of money for their services. And so obviously they're not providing them, but that's not your problem. We got a show to do. Great guest tonight. By the way, if you are a Rumble listener or a listener on other platforms, I'll post it to the video to Rumble as soon as we're done. It just won't be, it won't be live over there for tonight only, but great guest tonight. Jonathan Cho is back. He is in Chicago covering the protests at the DNC where apparently Democrats have discovered the utility of police again. We'll get to that interview in just a moment. Also on the schedule tonight, the DNC Cringe Fest is currently in night three. Tim Walz is your feature entertainment this evening accepting his vice presidential nomination formally, formally, not formerly, formally, get it right. I'll review some of the best of the worst of the first two nights later in the show. And then announced just this morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics revised the last year of job creation down by nearly a million. Remember how they'd insist the economy is just so awesome, but you can't feel it because you're not observant enough. Well, turns out a lot of that was nonsense the whole time. Now they're just admitting to it, which itself may have a little bit of a strategy to it too. We will catch up with your Super Chats on YouTube as well. Of course, normally we'd do that on Rumble. My apology that we can't tonight, but we will catch up with YouTube Super Chats. And hey, remember ordinarily, the show is not only available by video on YouTube, Rumble, and X, but there are audio feeds of the show too, and those are unaffected tonight. So if you're an audio listener, don't worry about it. Wherever you prefer to listen to your podcasts, find those feeds, check out the podcast page of my website, mattchristensenmedia.com/podcast. And as always, we thank Tenet Media for hosting. Follow them on X, @watchtenet now, and Instagram @watchtenet for more great original content, breaking news, and viral videos. I got a personal moment. I got a text from my wife that my oldest son, right before bedtime, is watching and waving. So hello to my oldest son, Calvin. He's watching this evening. I appreciate him tuning in. Have a good night, son. Anyway, of course, the big political news of the week is the Democratic National Convention, but more quietly, there is what could be a significant development imminent. And actually, it's not even what could be. It is all but a certainty now. Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will drop out of the race. This according to a bunch of reports that started circulating this morning. Sources with knowledge say that kind of stuff. But it is confirmed that RFK Jr. will host an event in Phoenix on Friday afternoon to discuss the present historical moment and his path forward. You can tell what that means. That's just fancy language to say, I'm done, I'm gonna do something else. Earlier this week, his running mate, Nicole Shanahan, said on a podcast that they were considering quitting the race and endorsing Trump. Trump has been asked about giving RFK Jr. a cabinet position if he is elected, and Trump says he's open to it. Now, who does this help? What's the theoretical benefit here? Or who does this help, or who does this hurt? Now, obviously, if RFK is dropping out and endorsing Trump, one would assume that a lot, if not most or all of his support is gonna go to Trump. That's not necessarily a guarantee, but there is a significant amount of votes potentially in play here, if you believe the polling. Kennedy is pulling about four or 5% support nationally. And if you look in the battleground states, it's about that. A little bit higher or lower here and there, but about that. This is according to the RealClearPolitics polling average. And that's a fairly significant chunk, one out of every 20 voters, something like that. And again, if there's some kind of endorsement deal here, and RFK says, hey, Trump, I agree to drop out, in exchange, you make me secretary of this, or official guy of that. And he comes out and endorses Trump, then you'd think a lot of that, a lot of those RFK voters are gonna go to Trump. But not necessarily, I mean, they are their own independent people, just 'cause RFK tells you to go over here. You might be a Democrat who likes RFK, and you hate Trump, and you'll never go to Trump, despite what RFK is telling you. So who does this benefit? Who does this potentially hurt? Now, for a long time, my own personal thought on this was that name recognition alone from a Kennedy would probably pull more Democrats, even though RFK has some, I guess, what could be called conservative positions on certain issues. Namely, he's just anti-COVID or vaccine tyranny. But other than that, he's got a lot of standard big government Democrat positions too. So my thinking was always, well, Kennedy, big Democrat party name, he probably pulls more Democrats than Trump supporters, even though Trump supporters who think, or maybe people who are available to Trump, think Trump went, one of his big mistakes was the vaccine stuff, or leaning into COVID hysteria too much, so they're attracted to Kennedy. But if Kennedy's pulling more Democrats, as my initial thought would suggest, that means that him leaving the race would potentially benefit Kamala Harris, because those freed up voters would go back to the Democrat candidate. Well, is it gonna work out that way? Of course, if RFK's sending his votes to Trump, it wouldn't, but there's kind of a mixed bag of evidence so far. According to the odds makers, the bettors, the betting markets at least, this actually hurt Kamala's chances of winning, at least according to this Newsweek report that says a couple of the bookies have reduced Kamala Harris's chances of victory in response to this circulating news about RFK. Now, there are a few things going on right now too, it's not just RFK potentially leaving the race, it's all the nonsense at the DNC and that entire clown show, so could it just be the clown show reducing her odds? You could draw that conclusion. There is some polling in this story though that is in support of a Trump benefit potentially. New York Times CNN College poll over the weekend found 41% of Kennedy supporters in the key battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, saying they would vote for Trump if their preferred candidate, in this case Kennedy, dropped out of the race, 27% going to Kamala. So that's a fairly even split, but that is edge to Trump with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. getting out of the race. I said there's mixed evidence though, 'cause there is. If you look at polling, how it breaks down in the battleground states with or without third-party candidates like RFK Jr., it's kind of an even split. So this is according to a race to the White House analysis from, again, through Newsweek. They're a polling aggregator, an election simulator. But in the seven swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, this analysis says that Kamala benefits from RFK's presence, so if RFK stays in the race, Kamala benefits in four states. If RFK stays in the race, Trump benefits in three. They say that in Nevada and North Carolina, RFK is the difference between either major candidate winning. So they're saying RFK's presence or absence has the potential to flip a few battleground states, actually. In Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, with RFK on the ballot, sorry, it's Nevada and North Carolina, rather. That's the difference between a Trump win and a Kamala win, is what they're saying. But bottom line here, it's four or 5% of the vote that's at stake. I think Trump is very smart to make a play for that four or 5%. If he could scoop those RFK voters, say two to one, maybe even three to one, against Kamala, that could be enough of a difference where it counts. So with the Trump endorsement, potential cooperation in a potential cabinet, I gotta think that this move is edge Trump, of course, and we'll see if it plays out that way. - Tim, I know you had a thought about what the cabinet position should be. - Yeah, so, and you did touch on it in the little piece there of Trump might put RFK in a cabinet position. I'd just be curious if you personally would support Trump doing that. If not, why not? And if so, where would you like him to be, where would you like RFK to be put? 'Cause Sargon, for example, said, he put out a tweet saying, \"I hope Trump puts him in charge \"of the Department of Health.\" But where would you like it? Assuming you would like that at all. - I guess technically, Congress only has the authority to create these departments, right? But can we make a department of, I don't know, go to hell, Pfizer, something like that? A department of anti-vaccine tyranny? Maybe that's within HHS. Maybe that's what you do with RFK. Or I was talking to my wife earlier today. Put him in charge of the CIA. Why not? A Kennedy in charge of the CIA is only fair. I guess that's not technically a cabinet position, but isn't that still, the CIA position, that's Senate-confirmed, is it not? I can't remember. Cabinet positions are, too, though. So yeah, put him in charge of the CIA. Get some vengeance for his family. Anyway, I want to get to the interview early tonight because, frankly, what's going on outside the DNC, I think, is a lot more interesting than what's happening inside. Protesters are out in the thousands, maybe the tens of thousands, and you'll notice that policing is back. Police are forcibly moving people. Police are preventing people from getting inside the secure area of the venue. Police made dozens of arrests last night, arresting people who chose to ignore those orders from those police. So Jonathan Cho, of course, is an independent reporter who's usually covering all the insanity in Seattle. He was on the show in April to discuss that, but this week he's outside of the convention documenting what's happening in the streets of Chicago. Interview's about 15 minutes long. We'll see you on the other side. (upbeat music) (upbeat music) I'm outside the United Center right now, and officers have been called in. I've heard that they're going to potentially deploy some gas right now, but easily more than 100 Chicago police officers now lined up right outside the United Center after the activists ripped down fencing, several people arrested. So not sure how this is all going to end. Somehow this group of Antifa militants have busted through. Chicago cops fought them. These far left activists in black are trying to get close to Antifa, is trying to infiltrate this crowd of pro-Israel activists. It's going to be a complicated evening just managing all the people who are trying to bust through here in downtown Chicago. (upbeat music) (upbeat music) Welcome back. I am pleased to host my guest for the evening. Jonathan Cho is an independent journalist and senior fellow at the Discovery Institute. He is on scene in Chicago this week covering the protests outside the Democratic National Convention. Jonathan, thanks for making time for me. - Yeah, anytime Matt. - All right, so what's going on out there? What's happening in the streets? - Depends which day. I just, I'm recovering from a riot pretty much last night in front of the Israeli consulate in downtown Chicago. Hundreds of officers just cracking down on these Antifa militants who are burning U.S. flags and brawling and causing all kinds of problems. - Is it, are they actually being pretty heavy handed, the police officers? I've seen certain reports. It looks like they're busting people up a little more than usual maybe, or not? You tell me. - From my vantage point, I think it's refreshing to finally see officers being allowed to do their job. I mean, look, I'm not seeing, you know, officers on the ground right now, you know, brutalizing people. What I am seeing is a bunch of far left activists who aren't following orders, who aren't, you know, leaving the scene when they're being asked to disperse. And the activists, you know, charging towards officers. And when that happens, you have Chicago cops in riot gear, you know, again, taking people into custody. And that's what happened to the National Lawyers Guild of Chicago, you know, pretty much posted this morning that more than 70 people were arrested last night. - Yeah, I saw that. Reports of dozens of arrests from, at least according to the reporting I'm looking at, a leftist group with militant leanings called Behind Enemy Lines. And then there's another group called Sammy Dune, Sammy Done, I don't know what this is called, but they're saying it has terrorist connections. Do you know anything about that? - Yeah, look, Matt, there are so many groups this week that have flown in from all over the US, right? Not just from Chicago. These are, you know, professional activists. And the bottom line is all of them hate America. That's what it appears to be based on the signs, the chants. These are communists and Marxists. These are people who wanna bring a revolution to the US. They don't like the current free market capitalist system. Right, they believe in socialism or communism. And then mix in the anarchists who are there to take advantage of these moments to just cause chaos and destruction. And that's what you have. But again, I've covered a lot of these protests now, going all the way back to 2020 with the BLM riots. And I have never seen this many officers out on the streets, again, being given the green light to do their job. - Yeah, I would imagine that has something to do with the politics in play here. But you mentioned the various interests that are present. This is being characterized as pro-Palestine, anti-Israel stuff, get the US funding out of the war. Is that the predominant message or is it just kind of a blob of leftist interest? - Yeah, you hit it right on the head. It's a smorgasbord of everything. Everything under the sun. Look, I wanna be very clear to your audience. I've been covering these protests since October 7th, since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. It started off with the pro-Palestine chants, free Gaza chants. But if you really go back to the history of all the groups that are fueling this, they all come from the communist, revolutionary, working class Marxist camp. It's these young white kids with purple hair. It's Antifa mixed in, and they're pushing this. Again, this is all part of their messaging to take down the capitalist system. And they see Israel at the forefront of that right now. So this aligns perfectly with all of their other interests. But funny enough, you have a lot of Muslims now mixed in with these groups. And some of my Muslim colleagues and also friends will say right now, we see them as useful idiots. But again, if you think about what all of these far left groups represent, especially LGBTQ, the Muslims, if you look at the Islam, it's one of the most conservative faiths in the world. And they don't want anything to do with the lifestyle some of these people are living. - Of course, the characterization is always mostly peaceful. How would you measure, I guess, what is the militant wing of what's going on versus the people who are there in good faith just to express their opinion? - Yeah, look, there's no doubt in fairness that some of these protests that have broken out across the US for Palestine are mixed in with families, children. But on the ground here in Chicago right now, I've seen no kids, I've seen no families, I've seen no grandparents at these things. It's the professional, it's the 20 somethings with pink and purple hair. It's the Antifa folks wearing black block and then everyone else covering their faces with kafiyas. And then you see their action. Two nights in a row now, night number one outside the United Center, you had Antifa militants taking apart pieces of the fencing, the security perimeter around the United Center. Several arrests the first night. And then last night in front of the Israeli consulate, so far the largest clash with cops, more than 70 people arrested according to reports on the ground. So we'll see what happens tonight and of course on the final night of the DNC. But all of this is happening outside of the DNC. For the most part, everything inside has been business according to plan. - How is this influencing or interacting with the DNC itself, if at all? Is it having any consequence for the attendees? - You know, I've got to give credit so far to the organizers of the DNC. To give you a sense of really what's happening here, the DNC is happening primarily in the United Center. Some of the other events happening in McCormick Place, this is all on the south side and west sides of Chicago. And it's heavily fortified. You're not getting in unless you have a badge, unless you have a media badge or a ticket to attend the DNC and there's heavy security everywhere. And cops are constantly following the protesters. And the protests usually start at this place called Union Park, just minutes from the United Center. They gather there, they rally, they chant, they protest, and then they walk the streets. But then you have police choppers up, you've got officers with canines, you have the SWAT team trailing behind, firefighters, ambulances. So this is, again, an area right now of the city that is being watched very carefully. And I would argue, with all the cops, maybe the safest part of the city. - I saw you posted on Monday that you heard some police saying they were potentially ready to deploy gas. Did that ever happen? - No, it didn't. And that was the first night. I've heard officers say numerous times that they were going to deploy gas. In fact, one of the officers was heard on the recording telling his fellow officers to get ready as well. But again, the gas only would have been deployed if the militants refused to leave the area. But after some pushing and shoving, they eventually dispersed without the gas being fired at anybody. - What's on the docket for today and tonight? What's coming up? - Well, the DNC night three is happening inside. That, I'm assuming, is gonna be everything according to plan. But what's happening outside is really where the intrigue is right now. There's another planned protests. There are also several communist and socialist gatherings where they talk about mobilizing and planning for the future. Last night, I was at a local church that was being used by a group called Worker Strike Back. And it was a group of socialists that were really talking about what's at stake here in the US. And they're trying to use these national platforms like the DNC to really rally the troops and also indoctrinate and recruit into their organization. So it's just fascinating, Matt, right now, what's happening in the US. And you rarely hear about this in mainstream corporate media, but all of these different groups outside of the Democrats and Republicans. You know, and I wanna emphasize, a lot of these protesters, they hate both parties. So you have people on the ground right now who want an alternative to the current free market capitalist system that's just not working out for them. - Yeah, I turn on the news in the morning, excuse me, and it's like a five second mention of what's going on outside. So in addition to just the volume, and I suppose the at least marginal popularity of this ideology, what do you feel like is going on in Chicago that just isn't discussed in your traditional news channels? - I mean, everything I laid out, there's nuance to what's going on. It's really a shame. You know, I haven't really had the time yet to look at some of the, you know, left-wing legacy media coverage from ABC, NBC, CBS. But, you know, that's why, you know, most of the reporting is coming, you know, on the ground from the independents, you know, and they're putting it on X and other social media platforms right now. But I think, you know, Americans need to wake up about what's happening. There is a revolution that is forming, mobilizing. We're seeing it real time right now outside of the United Center. You have groups, I wanna be very clear, who have been flown in from all over the US. These protesters aren't just from Chicago. You have people from all over the US who are like-minded, who don't believe in the current system, they don't believe in either political party, and they have a communist Marxist ideology that they are trying to push and they wanna bring mainstream. And that's what's happening right now. That's why we're seeing these protests. It's not just a pro-Palestine protest out there. You have everything else under the sun, including reproductive rights. You have groups advocating for migrant rights. And of course, you know, again, their own agenda. And then you just have people there that wanna latch on and cause problems. So we'll see what happens tonight. - Yeah, I'm trying to get a read about how serious these people are in their opposition, because of course, it's not the first time we've seen left-wingers protest the Democratic Party and then come home come election day. Do you have a sense in talking to these people or interacting with them, how serious they are in their opposition? Do you think they'll come home come November, or are they gonna stand strong against the party? - I mean, it's hard to tell. First of all, I haven't really had a chance to talk to the actual protesters on the ground, 'cause they're so focused on protesting. And I'm trying to stay safe by keeping a distance. But again, by listening to the chants, reading the signs, I mean, these are the same folks. They don't subscribe to either party. They're holding their noses and maybe possibly voting for Democrats. These are far left-leaning groups. They hate Trump no matter what, and they don't believe in Kamala Harris. And they wanna bring their ideology into the national spotlight. And that's what they're ultimately trying to do with these protests. - Speaking of your own safety, I know it's been under threat in your traditional Seattle reporting and elsewhere. Have you been okay out there? Has anyone given you a hard time? - You know, it was kind of weird. This happened in Milwaukee when I was at the RNC as well, and it's happened here in Chicago. But some of the militants, they have cameras and phones as well. They went around and started snapping photos of me and my colleagues out here in the field. So I'm just wondering if they recognize me or if they're keeping a record of who some of the reporters are on the ground right now who may not be aligned with their interests. So I wonder, we've been watching our backs, but we've been safe so far. We've been playing it smart. We've been staying near the cops as well. And like I said, I think that's the real story here at the DNC so far. The number of police officers, and maybe in other cities where protests happen regularly like Seattle, I can tell you the officers trail far behind. Here in Chicago, you have officers visible, front and center, near these protesters, near the activists, really trying to send a message. Because again, from a tactical and strategic standpoint, if you talk to a lot of these officers in these West Coast cities when they're dealing with these activists, they try to keep a distance 'cause they don't want to, they don't want their presence to trigger the protesters. But here in Chicago, it's almost the opposite. It's like CPD is trying to say to the activists, \"Hey, we're watching, we're right behind you. \"Don't mess around, keep it peaceful.\" - And is that effective in your observation? Is it deterring the excesses of these protesters? - You know what's crazy, Matt? I think so far, past couple days, we've seen the fences come down. We've seen punches being thrown. We've seen the arrests. But I feel like it could be far worse if we didn't have the strong police presence here in Chicago. And again, the ability of these officers to actually start doing their job. - Have you heard any explanation for why the difference? Obviously, cynically, I'm gonna conclude Democrats want to minimize this scene, and so they're gonna be forceful in stopping these people. But is there some other explanation for why the change? - Look, I'm speculating as well, but look, of course it's the DNC, you know, the Democrats, and this is Chicago, a strong Democratic stronghold. They don't want to be embarrassed, you know, in their home host city. But, you know, number two, I think the Democrats have also been getting a lot of criticism as the party that really doesn't care about law and order, right? The party that's allowed the criminals to go free. And, you know, I think at least at the DNC, what they're trying to say is, \"No, we do care about law and order, \"and we're gonna prove it. \"We're gonna have a great DNC. \"We're gonna make sure it goes off without a hitch.\" And again, so far, just if we kind of look at the big picture, it has been a successful DNC from a logistics and operational standpoint. - Well, that's my guest, Jonathan Cho. You can follow him and all of his excellent reporting at ChoShow on X, that's C-H-O-E-S-H-O-W on X. You can find the Discovery Institute at discovery.org. Jonathan, is there anything else you'd like to promote or places people can find you? - Yeah, no, thanks, Matt, that's great. But again, like you said, I think the key here is keep following the independent journalists and reporters. The real stories that are happening on the front lines, you're just not gonna see in that 30-minute newscast on corporate television. So social media, citizen, independent journalism really is where the action's happening. - Well, thanks for your time tonight. I know you're very busy these days, and of course, I appreciate all your effort getting the scenes that other people want. - All right, Matt, thanks again, take care. (upbeat music) (dramatic music) - Thanks again to my guest, Jonathan Cho. Follow him and all his reporting at ChoShow on X. That is linked in the description for you. You can also find his work at the Discovery Institute at discovery.org. A couple of items on the protest and the policing of it that I did not discuss with Jonathan, but I think are relevant. Kim Fox, the Cook County State's Attorney in Chicago, you may know her from originally letting Jussie Smollett off the hook fame. She announced preemptively this week that she will not be prosecuting any of the people arrested during these protests, at least for misdemeanors, low-level crimes, things like disorderly conduct and public demonstration and unlawful gathering and criminal trespass and all the January 6th crimes that are otherwise terrorist adjacent, but not in Chicago. Which is further demonstration, or I take it as further demonstration, that this is all calculated for politics and optics, obviously, not justice. Democrats will crack down on the protesters to get them out of the way, at least the inconvenient ones, 'cause they don't want the scene, but they're not actually gonna pursue them in court. This is a wink, wink, nudge, nudge type relationship. And lastly, isn't it amazing how quickly one's philosophy on policing can change? I guess it's not that quick, to be fair, but just four years ago, Kamala Harris was campaigning for vice president then, and she was speaking muffled through a mask, and she was saying, you know, it's very outdated and wrongheaded to think that policing means more public safety. - Let's talk about America's failure when it comes to understanding how you create safe communities. And by that, I mean this. It is outdated, it is wrongheaded thinking to think that the only way you're gonna get communities to be safe is to put more police officers on the street. What we have to do, and what we will do, is reimagine public safety. - Ah. So I guess Kamala needs to get out there on the streets of Chicago and tell them to reimagine their strategy for dealing with these protesters. It's very outdated, it's very wrongheaded. Or maybe Kamala and the rest of the Democrats did reimagine public safety, and they found out that the alternatives are greatly inferior to policing. So they went back to outdated and wrongheaded, except now it's current and correct. Would be a great question to ask her, by the way, if anybody had access to ask her a meaningful question. Yes, Tim? - Yeah, so you asked the question to Jonathan Cho there, that I think is interesting. There was the people back when the primaries were going that went out and did the voting, anybody but Biden, when that was an option. I'm curious what you think they're gonna do, because I think this might be a crossover of people. They went out of their way to vote, but they went out of their way to vote for someone that they didn't want in power. So it seems like they would vote, but they won't. I don't know if I'm explaining that very well, but-- - I think the Israel-Palestine stuff, the uncommitted voters, I think it has legs. I've talked about it a little bit, and I got into it a little bit on the Sunday show, too, so I don't wanna belabor the point. But I kind of believe these people, when they say that they're going to reject the Democrat Party, that they won't come home on the basis of opposition to U.S. support for Israel. I think this is more than just like your typical college protest type stuff, where they make a scene and come back to vote Democrat in the fall. Not for all of them, but I think the actual Dearborn vote, the Somalis in Minneapolis, for example, I kind of believe them that this is enough of a difference maker for them that they will stay home. Maybe some of them, at least I've heard some of them. There are news reports with some of them talking about how they're gonna vote for Trump. Now, to me, that doesn't make a lot of sense, because if you are anti-U.S. support for Israel, I mean, Trump has been a strong supporter of Israel. Whether you agree with that or not, it doesn't make sense to me to leave the Democrats to go to Trump on that basis, even though I think you should leave the Democrats and go to Trump. But anyway, long story short, I buy them as mostly sincere. I don't think it's just a gimmick, but we'll have to wait to find out. Anyway, can I get through two nights worth of DNC cringe and still have enough time to talk about the jobs report? That is my challenge, Tim. So let's see if I can do it. Of course, these are just kind of my personal highlights of the event so far. This isn't the most consequential or substantive stuff, but it's really the stuff I find the most entertaining, and that's what the DNC is so far. It's just feel-good stuff. It's just entertainment stuff. There's very little policy, almost none, and I know that that's kind of what conventions are supposed to do. Nobody gets up there and reads a long list of policies A, B, and C, 'cause that's mind-numbingly boring. But at the same time, what do these people actually stand for? Where do they stand on the issues? You don't really know, at least officially. The platform they released still referenced Joe Biden a million times because they couldn't bother to edit his name out of it. So tonight, and I'm sure it's probably happening right about now, if not right about to get underway, but Tim Walz is going to officially accept the vice presidential nomination. Kamala Harris will officially accept the presidential nomination tomorrow night. Last night was the Obamas. We'll get to that in a moment. And as far as what was probably the main event so far, the Joe Biden farewell speech on Monday, I talked about the greatest hits of lies, his greatest hits album of lies, that was that speech in the video that I posted on Tenet earlier today. So you can check that out if you want my thoughts on kind of the substance of Joe Biden's speech on Monday. But as I mentioned, I'm not really here to talk policy 'cause neither are the Democrats. They're just here to hate Trump and try to make you feel morally superior for joining them in that hatred. And it's very hard to make themselves look superior when they're very clearly inferior. And I don't mean that just politically, though I think obviously their politics are. I mean that just like inferior in normal person stuff, certainly inferior in masculinity. What does this convention offer to men? Nothing. I don't think there's a drop of testosterone in that entire building. Probably treat it like a TSA at the airport. You gotta pour out your water from your canteen, from your water bottle. You gotta pour out your testosterone upon entry. It's not allowed in here. Case in point, here is how the two events compare. The DNC and the RNC in the style of removing one's shirt. - The great American poet, Nelly. It's getting hot in here. (crowd cheering) Enough was enough. And I said, let Trumpamania run wild, brother. Let Trumpamania rule again. Let Trumpamania make America great again. - That was United Auto Workers Union President, Sean Fain, giving you the, I guess, the great value Hulk Hogan, or the Hulk at home type performance. Why am I supposed to trust people who look like they're about to die to bring me prosperity? Why is that? Why am I supposed to believe them? I have no idea, but Tim, you had a thought. Or not. - No, I think my hand was still up from the last thought, actually. - Okay, well, I'll keep going. - Yeah, it's wish.com, Hulk Hogan, I think that guy is. - Oh, wish, thank you. - Not even that, 'cause-- - Make a wish, I guess that's for kids only. Can adults go to wish.com? I don't know how that works. - I don't think so, but maybe not even that, 'cause at least wish.com kind of looks like the thing, just a cheap version. He doesn't even look like Hulk Hogan. - Yeah, well, speaking of people who look dead or close to it, that brings us to Mark Hamill. They got the celebrities all out in force. I don't mean to smear Steve Kerr there, the Warriors coach, as looking nearly dead. Of course, he's a very courageous man to speak out in favor of Democrats within his celebrity culture and in the Bay Area of California. That was his speech. Look how brave I am to face the consequences that I do. Yes, brave indeed. But here's \"Star Wars\" actor Mark Hamill with DNC chair Jamie Harrison to kick off the event earlier this week. And Mark Hamill's gonna warn you, please do not go to the orange side. - Mark Hamill here with the head of the DNC, Mr. Jamie Harrison. Listen, Mark, you got an important election coming up in November. You got a message for everybody out there? Well, in the movies, I fought against make-believe evil. But we're at a time in our history we were fighting against real evil. So I beg you, please don't go to the orange side. - Mark Hamill is about to go to the dead side, but at least the dead side is not orange, I guess. As joked on Twitter, it looks like he's been smoking with Hunter and drinking with Kamala. That was a good one. I liked it. But to his actual point, to Mark Hamill's actual point, oh, the opposition is evil. That's quite interesting. I thought this was the party of unity. This was the party of everyone coming together. Disagree with us in your evil though. Speaking of evil, I noticed you guys are sacrificing children outside of the event. Some might call it evil. I noticed you guys are in favor of changing children's genders, some might call evil. Please tell me more about how God has no place in the public sphere. At least that's a common democratically aligned view. Seems kind of evil. The accusation of evil can at least as credibly be aimed inward at the DNC, but of course it won't be. Because all they have is hating Trump, as Mark Hamill just did. - Mark Hamill here was the head of the DNC. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to repeat it. We already heard you once, get out of here. But that Mark Hamill energy of just hating Trump is really the embodiment of the entire event. This according to an analysis of word choice and topic and theme during the first night. And you will be unsurprised probably to learn that Donald Trump through all of the speaker speeches was mentioned 147 times according to this accounting. How many times did he talk about the border? Eight times. How many times did he talk about crime? Six times. How many times did he talk about inflation? Just three times. In other words, they are not talking about the issues that by polling Americans care about. They are just selling feelings and Trump hate. But you're a very, very good person if you buy into that. And everybody else is very, very bad. A few other highlights. One of the big selling points for Kamala Harris, of course, it's not just that she'll be the first woman president, she'll be the first woman of color president. Excuse me, woman of color president. Why did I say that so weirdly? Yeah, whatever. This according to, well, according to New York Governor Kathy Hochul, she won't just be the first woman of color president though. She will be the first president, period. - Democrats! Are you ready to elect Kamala Harris the first president of the United States? Yes, you are. Yes, you are. - The first president of the United States. George Washington would like a word, but he's a boring white male. He doesn't count. And actually, when I think about what Kathy may mean, she's probably correct. Kamala Harris may indeed be the first president of the new United States after her presidency here causes the second secession and second civil war, perhaps. I don't know if we're going that direction, but maybe she'll be right in that regard. Now, before Joe Biden gave his speech, he was introduced by his daughter, Ashley. Ashley is the only child between Joe and Jill, Hunter and Beau and Naomi. Naomi died as a child in the car crash that killed Joe's first wife and the mother of Beau and Hunter and Naomi. So Ashley is the only child of Joe and Jill. And Ashley took the mic and she immediately started describing a childhood memory, which seemed like it was about to get really weird. - Good evening. I have this memory. It's the eve of my eighth birthday. Dad is still in DC, tending to urgent matters in the Senate. - Thank God dad is not actually in town 'cause everybody thought she was gonna talk about showers with dad. She didn't go that direction. Thank God. And why is Ashley Biden on the stage? Well, because Hunter, you can't put Hunter on the stage. And I don't know how many times I've been reminded by Joe Biden that Beau has passed away, my sources say. In fact, I think he's died a hundred different times in just the last week or so. But actually the story that she told was about dad coming back to surprise her for her eighth birthday. So maybe one of the inappropriate showers that she wrote about in the diary did happen for her eighth birthday that year. She did not clarify. Now, the biggest fraud about Joe's speech arguably was not Joe himself. Though, of course, as I described in the video I posted earlier today, almost everything he said was a provable lie. Not just according to me or according to people who oppose him politically, but according to the fact checkers that usually favor him. It's total nonsense. But the biggest fraud was probably Nancy Pelosi in the crowd holding up the \"We love Joe\" sign along with the crowd. This, of course, after Nancy personally bullied him out of the campaign with threats reportedly to do it the hard way, presumably the 25th amendment. So watch Nancy as she chants \"We love Joe\" with the crowd and you decide how sincere she is. - We love Joe, we love Joe, we love Joe, we love Joe, we love Joe, we love Joe. - Clearly doesn't love him very much. Or loves him when he goes away. Maybe that's when Nancy and the rest of them love Joe the most. When he gets off the stage and is never seen again. Nancy Pelosi is so nervous and awkward she can hardly keep her dentures in, as you can see right there. So it doesn't seem like even Nancy Pelosi believes Nancy Pelosi on this one. And why would she? She went on CNN and she said exactly what I'm saying. She said, \"Well, I just did what I had to do with Joe.\" - You know what? - How do you talk to him is my only question. - I have to do what I have to do. - Right. - He made the decision for the country. My concern was not about the president, it was about his campaign. - Yeah, what she had to do was undermine the voters in pursuit of power. That's what she's saying there. And that comment just seems flippant and maybe insignificant, but you really should listen to what she's saying there and think about the implications. She is saying that Democrat leadership will do whatever they must to gain or maintain power. Not even respect among themselves is good enough. Again, Joe Biden, her longtime colleague. Not even that respect can overcome the thirst for power, let alone respect for you. If you think this woman has respect for you, the voter, she doesn't even have respect for her corrupt friend over there who's ruled DC with her for the last, I don't know, 30 years, 40 years, 50 million years, I don't even know, longer than I've been alive. So that's a big statement that she makes there. \"I did what I had to.\" Yes, but I'm sure she abides by the rules in every other context. She never does what she has to when it involves abusing you. And that brings us to the Obamas. Michelle went up there first. Michelle of \"they go low, we go high\" fame, which of course is just a platitude that she doesn't mean because she uses the cheapest possible attacks that she can. Here is a sampling of her speech last night in which she says her parents were skeptical of anyone who has more than they need. She says Democrats never cheat or change the rules and she says Trump hates her and Barack because they are successful black people. - She and my father didn't aspire to be wealthy. In fact, they were suspicious of folks who took more than they needed. They understood that it wasn't enough for their kids to thrive if everyone else around us was drowning. If things don't go our way, we don't have the luxury of whining or cheating others to get further ahead, no. We don't get to change the rules so we always win. If we see a mountain in front of us, we don't expect there to be an escalator waiting to take us to the top. No, Donald Trump did everything in his power to try to make people fear us. See, his limited narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hardworking, highly educated, successful people who happen to be black. (audience applauding) - Okay, on taking more than you need and skepticism of anyone who takes more than they need. A friendly reminder, the Obamas own three multi-million dollar homes. So I guess you don't, you didn't, your mom's skepticism doesn't apply to you or you didn't follow that skepticism and the wisdom of it supposedly later in life. And by the way, how did they obtain this wealth? It was built, of course, on the back of the taxpayer. I'm not saying all their money has come from the taxpayer, but why are the Obamas known? It's because they built fame on the public dollar. That's where that money came from. Then they wrote books and they'd speak and they'd do all, but people wouldn't care about that stuff if they didn't use the public platform to do it. On cheating and changing the rules. Okay, I will submit to you the entirety of all the COVID nonsense in which Democrats changed election rules in several states. I'll submit to you the constant abuse of presidential powers to pursue the preferred ends of the Democrat party. Indeed, at least under the Biden presidency, they still pursue them. Even when the Supreme Court says, \"No, you can't do that, it's unconstitutional.\" Joe Biden goes out there and goes, \"Oh, I'm gonna do it anyway. \"And I'm gonna brag about it while I do, \"while telling you that I'm actually the guy \"who protects institutions.\" Yes, please tell me more about following the rules because Democrats never break them. In pursuit of their ends. Nancy Pelosi just said, \"I did what I had to.\" What does that mean? Oh, I followed the rules, is that what it means? No, I break the rules 'cause the rules had to be broken. That's what Nancy Pelosi said. On this nonsense about hard work and no easy escalators to the top. The Democrat party exists to try to take people's money to build escalators to the top for other people. That is their entire platform. Is this the party of work hard, climb your own mountain yourself, build something impressive on the top, and then we'll help you protect it, we'll help you grow it? No, it's the party of take something from that guy and build an easy way to success for you. The party is nothing but easy escalators to the top. And then this nonsense about Trump and racism. Yeah, the only possible reason. And I get it, she's talking about birtherism and stuff. Were there Trump criticisms of them that were race-adjacent? I guess. It's not like Trump ever came out and called them Ns or something like that. But was that, as far as public opinion of the Obamas that was critical, was it really about their race? And if Trump never did the birther stuff or if Trump had criticized them in more polite terms, do you think people would have a less critical view of the Obamas? Maybe they don't like the Obamas because of the massive government takeover of healthcare. Maybe they don't like the Obamas because he's the guy who pretends like he's this upstanding dude who follows all the rules and is this moral man. Meanwhile, he drones an American citizen extrajudicially. The guy committed murder effect and got away with it. Okay, maybe they don't like the Obamas for that reason. Maybe they don't like the Obamas because we spent a bajillion dollars on nonsense prolonging an economic recovery. And this claim, at least the implicit claim, oh, the country dislikes successful black people. No, the reason the Obamas are celebrities, at least the celebrities that they are, is precisely because of their race. The fact that they're black makes them more appreciated by the people in their party who appreciate exactly that sort of thing. Case in point, look at the Clintons. Who's more beloved, the Obamas or the Clintons? And why? I mean, I'm not saying they're exactly the same other than their race. I'm just saying that they have a similar, you know, the president and the family. Clintons almost had two presidents. People adore the Obamas, the Clintons, not as much. Why? I mean, if people hated successful black people, and that was so common, you wouldn't see that dynamic. The Clintons would be the superstars of the Democrat Party. Instead, they've been overtaken by the Obamas. All right, a few more items I will submit. Oh, actually, I didn't even get to Barack Obama yet. That was just Michelle Obama. I'm not even done with the Obamas. Barack Obama walks out, and he's got an even more outrageous message, I think. He says that conservatives think that generosity is for suckers. - The other side knows it's easier to play on people's fears and cynicism, always has been. They will tell you that government is inherently corrupt, that sacrifice and generosity are for suckers. We have a different task. Our job is to convince people that democracy can actually deliver. - Okay, define generosity, because government redistribution is not generosity. That is legalized, dressed-up theft that is still going to your neighbors and pointing a gun at them if they disobey and taking their money and giving it to other people. You wanna talk about generosity as in voluntary charity, helping people out through the kindness of your heart, not using government as a redistributionist intermediary. There's plenty of survey evidence that shows that conservatives, Republicans, right-wingers, the people who think generosity is for suckers, that they are actually more generous. They make more generous donations to charity, or they give more charitably to their communities and to their neighbors. You can read about the details of that in this story here, but generally speaking, Republicans were identified, according to this survey, as the heaviest givers, which amount to $5,000 or more per year. 12% of Republicans fell into that category compared to 4% of Democrats and 3% of Independents. If you are a truly generous person, you don't need the government to seize your money by force and give it to others. In fact, that's the least efficient way to help people in need. Why? Because all the people like the Obamas have their hands in the cookie jar. So for this guy to get up there and smear people who have actually built things in their lives in the private sector is not generous, because him and his wife, who have just leeched off the public dime their entire lives, think that they have some superior plan for how money ought to be distributed, that's not generosity, okay? You are just a dressed up crook. You are just a dressed up mugger. That's it. So again, this false moral superiority that they claim is just ridiculous. That brings me to someone who's maybe even more dislikable, or unlikable, whatever the word would be, than the Obamas. That would be Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. And she gave Tim Walz, the vice presidential candidate, the sort of endorsement that nobody wants. She said on MSNBC this week, \"Oh, I love Tim Walz. \"My girls, my daughters say he's just like the male me.\" - I love Tim Walz. So Tim, my daughters were saying to me, you know, he's like a male version of you, Mom. And I thought that was so funny. - Minus the red lip, I can see it. - But he's rocking a purple tie in honor of the Vikings and Prince. So like, he's always on message. - Now I hate to have the Vikings defamed that way as a loyal fan, but they of course ask for it, you know? So I suppose they deserve it. But what's more embarrassing, being the male Gretchen Whitmer, or the female Tim Walz, which maybe Gretchen Whitmer is, and the correct answer is there is no difference. They are both estrogen-fueled COVID tyrants. So I get why they admire each other. Meanwhile, speaking of Tim Walz, the latest Tim Walz lie has dropped. Of course, we have stolen valor, which itself includes several sub-lies. We have lying about being deaf to try to get out of a DUI. We have lying about being a head football coach. He was, you know, only an assistant football coach. All of these lies, you know, there's like a nugget of truth, but they're exaggerated. Well, that's kind of where the new lie falls into. We have the IVF lie, as in Tim Walz saying that he and his wife conceived their children through in vitro fertilization, which they did not. Here is Walz making that claim back last month, and then a CNN panel at the DNC trying to cover for it. - J.B. Benz knows nothing about that. And then he keeps going into all of these things. Today's IVF day. Thank God for IVF. My wife and I have two beautiful children. - That's not accurate, right? I mean, it wasn't IVF. It was a different procedure. And his wife, Gwen Walz, the first lady of Minnesota, is taking care to tell CNN that they actually used a procedure called intrauterine insemination. - IUI. - IUI. - They did use fertility treatments. It wasn't IVF. - Any one of the one in seven women who goes through fertility treatments, IUI is part of the suite of fertility treatments. It's a step below IVF. It's direct insemination versus creating embryos. I think that is a stretch to say that it's not part of the broader fertility treatment. - As a man, I would probably mess that up. - Look, I just have your facts right as you come out. You're gonna tell the story. It just, it opens up an opportunity. - I get it. It was inartful. It was not, it was not accurate. - It was not accurate. - It was not accurate. - Well, the distinction is IVF is not, or IUI is not under attack anywhere the way IVF is, but it is part of the suite of options. Most people begin with one and go to the other. - Right. That may seem like a small difference, like some on the panel are describing. There actually are pretty big differences between IVF and IUI, both physically and morally, some of which they got into there. But intrauterine insemination, which is what the Walz family actually did, this according to a statement from Walz's wife, Gwen. Without getting too graphic, IUI, I would just call turkey basting. You take the male component and you drop it right there next to the female component inside the body. And that will ensure that more male components have access to the female components, which makes fertilization more likely. And that is usually, as far as I understand, again, without having gone through the programs myself, that is usually an early infertility treatment option. In vitro fertilization, IVF, the term that Walz used, that is much more complicated. IVF involves the extraction of the egg from the woman, the fertilization of that egg outside the body, and then putting it back in. Now, obviously that makes IVF much more intrusive and a much more involved process, but that's also quite different morally. I think people exaggerate the degree to which IVF is politically opposed in this country. But I actually, I think the opposition is largely correct, strictly speaking. So I don't say that to dismiss the opposition. I just don't think that there's a huge ban IVF, like that's a broadly supported view in this country. I could be wrong, I guess. I haven't looked at a lot of polling on that, but that's just my guess. But IVF, the difference here, IVF does mean creating life that may be discarded. Assuming you agree that an embryo is a life. Not everyone agrees to that, but okay. If you define an embryo as a life, you're creating life that may be discarded. IVF usually creates multiple embryos. Embryos are then frozen for potential future use, possibly discarded if they're unwanted. So IVF, in that sense, is creating life and disposing of it. A very serious moral question, moral problem, obviously. IUI does not involve any of that. It's just insert the goods, fertilization, or implantation, or and implantation, I guess happens or not. But there's no creation of embryos that would then be frozen or discarded. You just have the one that's gonna implant or not. So when she says, well, IVF is not, or IUI is not under attack in the same way IVF is, as far as the defense for Walz's commentary, well, yeah, that's why. One involves creating life that is then discarded. The other doesn't. The question is, why did Tim Walz say it the way that he did? They're gonna say, oh, it's just like colloquial. It's just like the term people use. I don't think it is. I think the premise that she's talking about there, well, one of them's under attack. Yeah, that's why Tim Walz made the claim is because there's a perception that IVF is under attack, and there are people opposed to it. I guess maybe when I say perception, that's a little bit unfair. There are people who are opposed to it, think the practice should be banned, that exists. So to the extent it's under attack, that's why he characterizes it the way that he does. And it's not just one misspeak from an MSNBC appearance, which if he's just trying to speak colloquially, maybe I'd understand. But according to this reporting in the AP, he actually put out an email, a fundraising email in March, this after the Alabama Supreme Court released that opinion that said, yeah, if an IVF clinic accidentally destroys all your embryos, you parents can sue them. And it was, I think, mischaracterized because media said, well, they said embryos are children, and this means that you can't do IVF anymore, and so the clinics are gonna shut down. They ran with it. I don't think that was an accurate understanding or portrayal of the Supreme Court decision in Alabama, which I discussed at the time. But in response to that decision, Tim Walz put out this email, and the email was titled, \"Our IVF Journey,\" referring to him and his wife, and it went into detail about how they conceived their children. And then, of course, Walz made that appearance on MSNBC, saying if it was up to JD Vance, I wouldn't have been able to have a family, even though they never used IVF, to have their family. And so Gwen Walz put out that statement yesterday, saying, actually, it was not IVF. It was IUI. So Tim Walz has made a point of misleading on this, or overstating or mischaracterizing what actually happened. Sounds familiar with the rest of his pattern of behavior. All right, speaking of things that never happened, the booming jobs economy of the last year. Every time Biden and Democrats talk about any criticism of their economic policy, they just point to the jobs. There's so many jobs. Nothing but jobs everywhere. Best jobs economy ever. You can't walk down the street without being assaulted by a six-figure job. Why don't you have one yet? Everybody does. Even though we know from other analysis that I've talked about before, a lot of the job creation, and let's be clear about what this means. This doesn't mean job loss. It means that the government has been telling us more jobs were created than actually were. The jobs that are created, or rather have rebounded since the COVID nonsense, a lot of that has been going to immigrants, illegal immigrants even, depending on your definition of illegal. Are they illegal immigrants? Are they asylum seekers? Immigrant labor has been claiming a lot of those jobs, according to abundant evidence. But yeah, a lot of the jobs that were claimed as new jobs, they weren't even real. They were Tim Walz level hoax. So each month we get the jobs numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but those are actually estimates. They're based on employer surveys. They're based on indicators. They are not based on a hard accounting of real jobs out there in the real world. So later we get a revision. So the revision itself is not necessarily unusual. It happens each and every year, and we get it monthly too. We get, you know, actually, we thought it was this much, but it turns out it's this much or that much, up or down. That's not unusual. But the revision for this last year, as in April, 2023 to March, 2024, absolutely brutal. This morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that they were only off by 818,000 jobs. So here is a Fox News reporter breaking the news this morning. - Huge revision down, 818,000 fewer jobs. This is the, basically the government's overstated the amount of people in the workforce. And even when you look under this, manufacturing was down 115,000 people. So this was a revision down, a significant revision down, the largest in 15 years that we've seen. And it basically says that the government has now overstated the amount of people who are working in this workforce. It shows weakness in the job markets over the past year that we didn't realize was there, but now we know is there. - At least the scenery in Jackson Hole is great. I guess there's some kind of economic conference there. The Fed chair, Jerome Powell, is gonna be speaking there on Friday. I guess that's why the Jackson Hole report. By the way, when he says this is the largest annual downward revision in 15 years, that is not a small difference. The next largest revision down was 500,000 downward in 2019. This would be something in the neighborhood of 60% more than that revision downward. And the clue was always there. Oh, you know, let me grab it. Where's my, I forgot to put this up in my list in my list of pages here, or open it in my browser. But let me grab it so we have it for reference, because the clue was always there about the state of the job market, or about the state of how many people are working. Because we can always look at the labor force participation rate. Labor force participation rate is just a measure of how many people are actually working or looking for work. And the labor force participation rate has still not recovered to where it was before all of the COVID nonsense. You can see in February 2020, it was 63.3%, as in 63.3% of the population is either actively working or actively looking for work. Then you have COVID hit, it takes a big drop. And ever since then, it's been a very slow climb. The entire duration of the Biden presidency, a very slow climb, almost back to what it was, but not quite. We've kind of plateaued around 62.5% or so, creeping up on 63%, but still a half point or so below, a half percentage point or so below where we were. And in the context of tens of millions of workers in this country, over 100 million, a half a percent does matter a lot. That's a lot of people. So how is it possible that we have all these hundreds of thousands of jobs popping up everywhere, but we're not seeing labor force participation move up meaningfully beyond where it was before all of this nonsense happened? We didn't. Those jobs, those jobs were always made up. Those jobs were always nonsense. Maybe not in totality. Obviously, we've seen improvement in the last four years, but we're still below where we were before any of this nonsense happened. So job creation, even as told, is debatable because it's just recovery back to the status quo. But yeah, the Democrats will still say things like Kamala Harris did when she gets on the stage on Friday and talks about her economic plan and says, \"Well, people out there, we can see all the progress, \"but people out there can't feel the progress. \"They can't feel the progress themselves.\" That's why. You lecture us about how great it is, but we don't see it 'cause we're not observant enough. No, it's 'cause it's fake. It's 'cause you guys made it up. And you have been doing that the whole time. But if the theory here is that the jobs numbers were inflated to make Biden or the federal government look good, what is the incentive to tell the truth right before the election in a way that makes them look bad now? Well, part of it is just the time of the year that they do it. I looked back in that prior revision where we had a revision of half a million jobs down in 2018, 2019, they released it at the same time, the revision downward, August 23rd, 2019. So part of it is just the routine. You wanna be cynical though, another part of it potentially is this provides reason for the Fed to start cutting interest rates again. So the Fed has been waiting for the job market to cool as a sign that it's safe to cut interest rates without risking further inflation. And the Fed may now do that right on time for Democrats to say, \"Look, interest rates are dropping again. \"Look at our soft landing.\" The problem is if they do that too early and it may very well still be too early, we have easy money circulation again and what happens? Inflation kicks right back up again. So is it gonna be the soft landing that they want or just this continued persistent turbulent cycle or do we just get the crash landing that we deserve standby? But I wouldn't trust these people, that's all I know. And if you trusted them on jobs for the last year or so, you shouldn't have and they proved that to you. All right, Tim, we got an email question. Let's get to that and then we'll catch up the chats. - We do. Before we get to that, I wanna just read a tweet that I saw, pardon, sorry, earlier. On ABC, it's an ABC clip. The reporter says to Gina Raimondo, she's apparently the Secretary of Commerce, \"Nearly a million jobs credits \"since Kamala took office do not exist.\" She says in response, \"I don't believe it \"because I've never heard Trump say anything truthful.\" It's from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. - Yeah. - And Gina says in response, \"I'm not familiar with that.\" Which, that was a weird statement. You're not familiar with the Bureau of Labor Statistics? - I guess charitably, she means I'm not familiar with that report. She's gotta be familiar with the Bureau of Labor Statistics. She is, what's her title? Labor Secretary or something? I forget exactly what secretary she is. - Secretary of Commerce. - Commerce, yeah. Economic, labor adjacent, economic related. She has to know what the agency is. I think she just means I didn't see the news of that. - I assume so, but it's just like, it's such a badly word. And it's also a, \"I don't believe Trump.\" It's like, well, it's not from Trump. Why would ABC be quoting Trump? - Remember when Kamala Harris said when the vaccine rollout happened, \"Oh, I'll never take a Trump vaccine.\" Meanwhile, then she joins the administration that tries to forcibly stab as many people in the country as they can 'til they got struck down on that. Speaking of following the rules and never cheating, Michelle Obama. Democrats were the party of trying to force everyone to take their experimental vaccine, even though it was illegal the whole time. And there's no recourse for the people they forced it upon. - And the rent moratorium and all the other- - Yeah, all the other nonsense. All right. - Anyway, so onto the email question. So this week is from Odie again. We've had a couple from him. Thank you for another one, Odie. Hi, Matt and Tim. We know that the Democrats will fortify the 2024 elections, though I doubt we will know the means of fortification that they will employ. So given that, what can Americans and Republican lawyers do to ensure that any legal challenges are not dismissed because of lack of standing, as was the majority of cases of 2020? Also, have you considered Rumble Studios? Scott Adams uses it and is a passionate advocate. Thank you for both providing me with some much-needed sanity on my Thursday mornings, and thanks extends to Blonde for the Sunday stream. All the best. Snow in prison night. - Well, thank you for the kind words and your support for the show. - We love you. You're very special. - As far as my response to the question, I hate to punt a little bit or leave you hanging. This is an advanced legal question that is above my pay grade. You're gonna have to get to a lawyer with knowledge of both standing and election law to answer those technicals for you, 'cause that's outside my wheelhouse. But of course, the principle of standing is that to bring a lawsuit or a legal challenge in this country, you have to have a direct relationship to that issue. You have to bear a direct consequence through the dispute. Just because you think a law is unconstitutional or otherwise illegal or you don't like the law, you can't necessarily just challenge it, especially in federal courts. The way the Supreme Court operates is by the doctrine of standing pursuant to Article Three of the Constitution. I don't know the ins and outs of all the technicals of that, but I will say it does lead to a lot of disappointing outcomes like you're talking about. Most recently, the challenge to the White House censorship, the cozy relationship between the White House and social media companies that was indeed, at least if you believe the evidence, awfully coercive, not just cozy, but coercive. The White House would tell Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, \"Hey, you should censor that guy,\" and then they did. That was dismissed by the Supreme Court for lack of standing. The Supreme Court didn't get into the merits of the case. They said, \"Because the White House \"didn't directly censor you, \"they just kind of worked with the people who censored you. \"That's not direct enough. \"You don't have standing. \"We're not gonna evaluate the case on the merits,\" which was very disappointing, but that's a lot of what happened in those election challenges in 2020 also. But the thing that makes this even more complicated, and again, why I say it's above my pay grade, is that you have different standing rules as far as I understand in states versus federal courts. And a lot of these election challenges have to happen in state courts. And so do I know how you establish standing in Pennsylvania or Georgia or Arizona or Michigan or Wisconsin? I don't. But I'll tell you, if the Republican Party doesn't have a team of lawyers looking at why those challenges in 2020 failed and thinking about how to make sure they can at least establish standing in 2024, they are foolish. Because as we've seen with cases dismissed on standing grounds in other instances, it doesn't matter even if you're right on the law. If you don't have standing, it's a non-starter. So I can't answer the technicals of that question for you, but I hope that the party is smart enough to be thinking about that problem and making sure that whatever issues arise, that they're able to find the appropriate parties that will have standing to bring cases that will be evaluated on the merits. If they have not done that or they're not doing that, they're very foolish. So that's my unsatisfying answer, Odi. I have to punt 'cause I'm not a lawyer with expertise in those technical topics, but I agree with your premise very much. It is crucially important. Now, as far as Rumble Studio, I'm unfamiliar with it. Again, what's going on with my technical problems with the stream is there's a third party called Restream that takes my stream and sends it to all the places where you may watch it. So that allows me to send one stream out there. It goes to Restream. Restream then sends it to YouTube, Rumble, X, wherever else, you know, my Sunday show, I've got a lot of different places. And so if that third party hub goes bad, I can't send the show to all the places it goes. And I got to go around that third party hub to get it in this case only to YouTube 'cause I can only send it to one place. Rumble Studio is a new thing that Rumble has launched. And as far as I'm aware, they offer that same sort of service as part of what the software can do or what their app can do. It will take your stream signal and it'll send it to all sorts of places. YouTube included, X included. So I haven't investigated this. Perhaps I will, especially if it's, I don't know if they charge for it. Restream does. I'm paying a pretty penny to Restream for a service that is not being provided. If Rumble's doing it for free, that's even more impressive. The one wrinkle I could see with Rumble is given my personal situation and my relationship with Tenet, I mean, I have to send the stream sometimes to my personal Rumble in the case of the Sunday show, sometime to Tenet's Rumble in the case of this show. Does Rumble Studio allow me to send it to their hub and go to different Rumble channels from that hub? I don't know. I have to investigate. But I'm gonna hit up Restream tomorrow. And if they can't give me a satisfactory answer, I guess I have to go shopping because it's not acceptable for me to sit down for a Sunday stream and now a Wednesday stream after testing it. Lo and behold, it doesn't work. And all of a sudden, people are expecting to find the show in a particular place, and they can't because that critical hub has failed. So hopefully they get it together. I don't wanna have to learn something new and shop for a new thing, but you gotta do what you gotta do. And they're making it tough on me for sure. So thank you for the recommendation, Odie. And of course, thank you for your email question as well. As a reminder, if you'd like to send an email question for consideration on the show, the way that you do that is by heading over to the contact page on my website, mattchristensenmedia.com/contact. Look for the MC Hour questions form. As always, that's linked in the description for you to find too. Okay, Tim, let's finish up with Super Chat and call it a night. - Okay, now we do actually have one that kind of threw on Rumble. It looks like- - Yeah, he got it. - You know the waiting screen you can have for YouTube or Rumble before the show starts? It looks like that's still in the tenant kind of listing. So I don't know if you need to delete that. - I'll take care of that when we're done 'cause I'm gonna post the show over on Rumble when we're done. So I'll just get rid of that. - Fair enough, absolutely, no worries. But anyway, so the one that's come through on Rumbles from Horty Twerkman, thank you. The clientele at my neighborhood Dollar Tree reminded me of Jonathan's Aurora Avenue clip, the woman with the body of a Bourdain Venus would have brought some class to the place. I don't know what any of that means. - Wait, what? Yeah, that one kind of lost me. Can you read it one more time? 'Cause I don't have it on my screen, so I have to just follow along with what you said. - No, I'll read it a little bit slower then 'cause I can go a bit fast. The clientele at my neighborhood Dollar Tree reminded me of Jonathan's Aurora Avenue clip. So obviously a previous story. - That woman with the body of a Bourdain Venus would have brought some class to the place. - Yeah, he's talking about what Jonathan Cho was talking about. That was the connection that I missed. - Right. - All right, thank you, Horty Twerkman. Appreciate it very much. - I think Dollar Tree and Jonathan is the only ones I understood it, but whatever. - Thank you, Horty Twerkman. - So yeah, just that one from Rumble and I'll go back over to YouTube. And it looks like we've got a couple from there. So firstly from Mint20, the streaming company hired too many H1B1 workers. - H1B workers, yeah. - Oh, H1B. What is H1B1? - Definitely worth checking into. - They probably do have their fair share of, well, I don't know, they might not even be H1B workers 'cause they might not even be here. They might be actually still in India or still in whatever country. - Yeah. - So who knows, man, you shouldn't defame them like that. They might, the people might be far away in a country on the other side of the world. Thank you, man. Hopefully I can solve the problem. - Anyway, and last one by the looks of it from Daniel Jaeger. After Trump narrowed Biden to the cross during the 2020 debates, stating that Biden didn't receive a single police union endorsement, Democrats panicked. - That could be part of it too. I know Jonathan was talking about that a little bit, that they realized the error, I think the political and the practical error of being so anti-police in the way that they were. And I know there's another side to it. Police, you have to have appropriate limitations on police chief. Among them, in my opinion, is making sure that policing is local. That's why you don't want federalized police because they are the least accountable. Make sure it's local. You make sure that police are abiding by constitutional restrictions. But generally speaking, there are bad guys out there and you need good, strong men to go take care of them. That's where police come in and you make sure that it's local and accountable to curb the excesses. So when I say that Democrats are politically and practically foolish, that's what I mean. It's politically unpopular to do away with the police force in that way, but I think it's practically unpopular because it creates, or it's practically damaging. It's damaging in practice because it creates the sort of insanity and chaos that's dangerous for the people living in these cities. So I could entertain the idea that Democrats have realized this and they're thinking, well, we got to fix it. We, politically, it's stupid of us. We have to come off as more pro-law enforcement. As a practical matter, it's destroying our cities, so we're doing a little course correct. I just don't hear them campaigning on that. I don't hear them campaigning on anything, as we've discussed. What is the issue that they've talked about? Kamala Harris has proposed communist-adjacent economics and that's really about it. I haven't seen Walz or Kamala Harris get on the stage and do some kind of turnaround about policing and explain what their policing philosophy is and how we could improve, or maybe even how they were wrong in 2020, mistakes that they made. I'm open to them having a sort of a philosophical realignment. I just don't hear them saying anything to that effect. - Yeah, just in reference to one of the things you said there, if you look at the Tiffany Henyad situation and how she's using police, if that was at federal level, who could oversee that and who could basically take care of that? - Yeah, that's why you don't want feds. - Exactly. Yeah, you'd be in trouble. And out of curiosity, I just jumped on Kamala's website when you were talking about not hearing anything. It still just says, \"Meet Kamala, meet Tim, \"take action, stall.\" There is no policy tab. - They're gonna get through their entire convention without discussing policy in that way. Thank you, Daniel. Appreciate it. - Anyway, it looks like Daniel just sent one more through. Carolyn Wren, senior advisor to Carrie Lake, might be a good guest to have on for election questions. - Yeah, or if she's easy to access, maybe an option for Odie to email too. I mean, I'm interested in the topic and if she's willing to talk, I would definitely talk about it. We could reach out, but I wonder if she's someone who might have expertise in the answers to the questions that were brought up. - Actually, would you like maybe Daniel to email you that and then you could pass on to me? I can see if I can track it down. - I will just copy and paste. I'll put it in our traditional communications channel. How about that? - No worries. - I'll do it right now. - Okay, well, yeah, I can definitely go looking for her, see what I can find. But that looks like it from YouTube. And even though they could, it doesn't look like anyone else has sent any more at Rumble. So that looks like it. - Okay, well, thank you for your contributions this evening, Tim. Always appreciate it. And of course, thank you to my guest, Jonathan Cho. You can find him at ChoShow on X. Again, linked in the description. You can find him at the Discovery Institute, discovery.org. That is also linked in the description for you. And thank you, dear listener, for tuning in. I'm sorry for the technical problems lately, and I intend to bang down whatever door I need to fix them. Thanks for your patience in the meantime, and thanks to Tenet Media for hosting as well. Follow Tenet on X, @WatchTenetNow, and Instagram @WatchTenet. We will be back Wednesday nights at 9 Eastern. This has been the Matt Christensen Hour on Tenet Media. Have a great night.
